In those days—for this was at the\\nbeginning of the eighteenth century—great attention was paid to the\\ncarriage of young ladies,—more than appears to be thought necessary\\nat the present time, to judge by the attitudes into which I often see\\nlittle girls throw themselves, even in company. They were taught to\\nsit and stand very upright, to carry their arms carefully, to turn out\\ntheir toes and hold up their heads. No stooping was permitted over\\nbooks or work; and while Lady Lucy was living with her aunt Bernard,\\nshe used to have a bunch of knitting-needles stuck into her bodice, to\\nkeep her from \"poking\" over her work.\\n\\nLady Lucy was young,—only a little past eleven years old,—and small\\nfor her age: nevertheless, she was the rightful heir of the splendid\\nroom in which she now sat, with its heavy carved furniture, its worked\\ntapestry hangings, and inlaid cabinets,—of the fine old house, Stanton\\nCourt,—of the lovely gardens and shrubbery which lay stretched before\\nthe windows, and the beautiful park, and many a farm and moorland\\nbesides. She could only just remember her mother as a delicate lady,\\nwith beautiful long black hair and dark eyes, who was very kind to her\\nand used to talk to her in a musical, soft-sounding language, which was\\nnot English, nor at all like any tongue she ever heard nowadays. When\\nLady Lucy learned to be confidential with Cousin Debby, she told her\\nof this strange language in which her mother used to talk; and Cousin\\nDebby informed her that the language was Italian, and that some day she\\nshould learn it herself.\\n\\nWhen Lucy thought of her mother, it was always as sitting down on the\\nfloor to play with her, or hearing her say her prayers, or else as she\\nlay in her coffin all dressed in white, when Aunt Bernard would make\\nthe child kiss the cold face, and called her an unfeeling, heartless\\ngirl, because she had cried and screamed to get away and had declared\\nthat that was not her mother. Lucy almost thought that she began to\\nhate Aunt Bernard from that moment. Certainly there was always war\\nbetween them from that day; and, though Aunt Bernard was the stronger\\nand compelled the child to obey, she never won her love.\\n\\nIt was not so very pleasant, after all, this being an heiress, with no\\nfather or mother to love and pet one, no little sisters for playmates\\nto help dress the doll or nurse the kitten, or to make foxglove dolls\\nand cowslip-balls, or tell tales in the seat under the tall old elm.\\nAunt Bernard said that, for her part, she meant to do her duty by\\nthe child: there would be people enough to spoil and flatter her\\nby-and-by. I really think, too, that when she began she meant what she\\nsaid,—though she was perhaps mistaken as to what constituted her duty\\nbut, as the time wore on, and she could not but see that Lucy disliked\\nher, she began in her turn to dislike Lucy and the poor child led a\\nhard life of it.\\n\\nAunt Bernard lived in a beautiful place. It was an old timbered house,\\nof which the beams were black with age and the plastered spaces between\\nmarked off into patterns. There was a beautiful though not very large\\ngarden, with green alleys and grass-plots, where Lucy would have liked\\nto play if she had been allowed, and where grew abundance of flowers.\\nAt the bottom of the garden was a tall hedge, clipped close and smooth\\nlike a wall, with arched openings leading through to another green,\\nbeyond which, again, was a pretty stream where ducks and geese, and one\\nold swan, sailed up and down all day long.\\n\\nLucy would have enjoyed playing on the green, and sailing little boats\\nupon the stream, and throwing bits of bread to the waterfowls but she\\nwas never allowed to do any of these things. If she ever ventured to\\nrun or romp, she was reminded that she was a lady,—a countess in her\\nown right,—and that she must not demean herself like the parson\\'s\\nlittle girls, who worked in the hay-field, or gathered cowslips for\\nwine in the meadows, or herbs and roots for their mother to distil\\ninto medicines and cordials. Lucy used many times to wish that she had\\nbeen the daughter of that stout, good-natured gentleman and his plump,\\nrosy little wife, who walked to church every Sunday morning followed\\nby their ten children, two by two, and looking so happy and pleasant.\\nTrue, the little Burgess girls hardly ever seemed to have new gowns\\nor hoods, even for Sundays, and their weekday frocks were coarse and\\nmended but she was sure that Polly and Dulcie Burgess were much happier\\nthan she was. But when she ventured to express this thought to Hannah,\\nher aunt\\'s waiting-woman, Hannah reproved her sharply, and added that\\nit served Mrs. Kitty Lindsay right for marrying a poor parson, that she\\nshould have such a host of children and nothing to keep them decent.\\n\\nPoor Lucy could not make hay, or gather primroses in the lanes, or\\ncarry jugs of skim-milk to the poor old people, as Polly Burgess did.\\nShe must practise on her lute so many hours a day, instead of singing\\nsweet old country songs and ballads like Polly and her sister. She must\\nwork at her sampler and her satin stitches so many hours more, and read\\nand write so much longer. She must read so many chapters in the Bible\\naloud to Aunt Bernard, taking them as they came, whether it were a long\\nchapter of hard names and nothing else, or a beautiful story in the New\\nTestament. She must learn her lesson standing in the stocks to make her\\nturn her toes out, and carrying a heavy bag of beans upon her head that\\nshe might attain a good carriage, or strapped up to a back-board or\\nlying flat upon the floor, to straighten her back.\\n\\nIf there was daylight enough after all this was done, she might walk up\\nand down the green path in the garden and around the shrubbery for a\\ncertain length of time. There was one place in her walk where Lucy was\\nout of sight of the garden-windows for some little distance and here\\nshe used to peep among the branches for the birds\\' nests, and strew for\\nthe robin-redbreasts the few crumbs she could contrive to save from\\nher breakfast. There was a garden-seat, too, old and broken, where she\\ncould venture to rest a few minutes and look at the sky or the water,\\nwhile she thought about her mother and wondered if she remembered her\\npoor little girl who was so very, very unhappy and lonely without her.\\n\\nLucy did not think so much about her father. She had only seen him\\ntwice since she could remember, when he had come from the wars. She\\nthought he must have been a good man, because her mother had been so\\nhappy when he came home; and she was sure he was kind to her and used\\nto give her rides upon his shoulder or his foot. She remembered, too,\\nthe day when the news came of his death, and she had been dressed in\\nblack and told it was for her dear papa who had been killed in the wars\\nabroad. But it was of her mother that she loved to think at such times,\\neven though the remembrance made her feel more unhappy than ever.\\n\\nPoor little Lucy! It was a sad, irksome life. It would have been dull\\nenough if Aunt Bernard had been kind to her but she was not. She did\\nnot love the little girl. She envied her because Lucy was rich, and\\nshe herself poor, or, at least, not wealthy. She had hated her mother\\nbefore her, and she visited it on her little daughter. Lucy could never\\ndo any thing right. Whether she sat or stood, ate or drank, worked,\\nread, or played, Aunt Bernard always saw something to find fault with.\\nNor was fault-finding the worst. Aunt Bernard carried a fan with a long\\nwhalebone handle, and there were few days in which the impression of\\nthat whalebone was not printed upon Lucy\\'s shoulders or arms, nor many\\nweeks during which she was not sent supperless to bed in the dark.\\n\\nShe would have fared worse than she did, if Margery, the cook, had\\nnot pitied the child. Sometimes Margery would contrive to bring her\\na cake or a biscuit; and when Mrs. Bernard went away on a visit with\\nher waiting-woman Hannah, Margery would make feasts for Lady Lucy in\\nthe kitchen, and sometimes allow her to bake little cakes for herself.\\nThese were Lucy\\'s happy days, when she could sit in a corner of the\\ngreat chimney and watch the cook bustling about her work, or the\\nmilkmaid bringing in her pails of fresh milk and carrying out buckets\\nof whey to the pigs. It made no difference to Lucy that her aunt always\\nforbade her going into the kitchen,—unless, indeed, it rather added\\nto her pleasure to think that she was disobeying Aunt Bernard and for\\nonce having her own way. It was perhaps the worst result of that lady\\'s\\nsystem of management that Lucy learned to take pleasure in deceiving\\nand outwitting her.\\n\\nOne day, however,—one memorable, miserable day,—all these surreptitious\\nfeasts came to a sudden end. I will tell you about it particularly,\\nbecause it was the means of bringing about a great change in Lucy\\'s\\nmanner of life.\\n\\nOn this day Aunt Bernard set out in her carriage to make a visit at\\nLangham Hall, some twenty miles away. She was to stay over-night with\\nLady Langham and return home the next evening. She left Lucy plenty of\\nwork to do, and many injunctions as to her conduct, and threats as to\\nwhat would happen if she were disobedient.\\n\\nLucy stood demurely at the door and watched the carriage out of sight\\nand hearing. Then she started and ran like a hare down the garden, and\\nthrough the gate in the holly hedge, to the water-side, but presently\\ncame running back to beg for some bits of bread to feed the swan.\\n\\n\"Bless the poor child!\" said kind old Margery. \"\\'Tis like a kitten\\nlet out of a basket, to be sure. But, Lady Lucy, my dear, had you not\\nbetter do your tasks before you go to play?\"\\n\\n\"I cannot do them all before my aunt comes home again,—no, not if I\\nwere to work all night, Margery!\" said Lucy, shaking her head. \"And if\\nI have the least bit undone I shall be scolded and beaten as much as if\\nI had not touched them: so where is the use? I may just as well play\\nwhile I can.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis true what the child says,\" remarked Anne, the housemaid, as\\nMargery looked grave: \"my mistress has left her marking and open-hem\\nenough for a grown woman, besides all her other tasks,—more shame to\\nher, I say, to have no feeling for her own flesh and blood! Never\\nmind, Lady Lucy: I will take hold of it when my work is done, and you\\nshall have one good play. But you must mind and wear your gloves and\\nyour hood, and not break your nails and scratch your hands with the\\nbrambles, or my mistress will find you out.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t feel right about teaching and helping the child to deceive her\\naunt,\" said Margery, when Lucy had rather unwillingly gone to seek her\\nhood.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care one pin,\" replied Anne, decidedly. \"If my mistress\\ntreated any of us with any confidence, or put any trust in one, it\\nwould be different; but so long as she and Hannah are always spying\\nand prying about, and won\\'t believe a word one says, even though it\\nshould be gospel truth, why, they may just find out what they can, for\\nall me. I shall just sit down and do up the child\\'s open-hem for her,\\nand my mistress may find out the difference if she can. It will not be\\nthe first trick I have played her in my time,—nor you either, Mistress\\nMargery.\"\\n\\nMargery sighed, and shook her head. She was not satisfied with Anne\\'s\\nreasoning, nor did her own conscience acquit her in the matter, but she\\nwas very fond of Lucy, and loved to see the child happy for once, as\\nshe said. So she set about making currant buns and a gooseberry fool—an\\nold-fashioned country dish, than which there are few better—for Lucy\\'s\\nsupper. But Lucy was not destined to the enjoyment of these dainties.\\n\\nShe played in the garden and down by the brook as long as she could\\nsee, forgetting for a while books, lute, and all the rest of her\\ntorments. She talked to Polly Burgess across the stream, and watched\\nher as she milked her own little black Welsh cow, wishing all the time\\nthat she had a cow to milk and take care of. At last she yielded to\\nAnne\\'s entreaties that she would come in out of the dew and eat her\\nsupper.\\n\\nShe had just settled herself comfortably at the little table which\\nMargery had set out in the corner, and was watching with quiet\\nsatisfaction the toasting of the currant buns, when the door of the\\nkitchen was opened, and Aunt Bernard, entering quietly as usual, stood\\ntransfixed with amazement and anger at the sight which met her eyes.\\nThere was Lady Lucy, in the kitchen, actually leaning with both elbows\\non the table, and her chin resting on her hands, watching Margery, who\\nwas on her knees toasting the buns, and laughing and joking with old\\nRoger, the cow-man; while Anne had actually a whole new mould candle\\nlighted at her elbow, and was busily working at the open-hem ruffle!\\n\\nAunt Bernard had gone more than half her journey, when she was met by\\na messenger sent to tell her that the family at Langham Hall were in\\ngreat trouble,—that the smallpox had broken out in the house, and my\\nlady\\'s two daughters were down with that dreadful disease, for which in\\nthose days no preventive was known. Of course all thought of the visit\\nwas now out of the question, and Aunt Bernard turned homeward in no\\ngood humour. It was destined to be a day of misfortunes; for about a\\nmile from home the carriage broke down, and Aunt Bernard was obliged to\\nwalk home, in her best brocade and carriage-shoes, over a road far from\\ngood in the best of times, and now sloppy and dirty from two or three\\ndays\\' rain. It was in no placid mood, therefore, that she opened the\\nkitchen-door, to find her family in her absence violating almost every\\nrule she had ever laid down for them.\\n\\nIt was upon Lucy, as usual, that her wrath fell heaviest. The poor\\nchild had never in all her sad life been so berated. Ladies in those\\ndays were used to employ language for which in these a housemaid would\\nbe dismissed; and when Aunt Bernard was angry there were few names too\\nhard to be bestowed upon Lucy. Nor was this the worst. Aunt Bernard\\ndeclared that Lucy was the true child of her mother, that foreign woman\\nwho had deceived and ensnared her poor brother to his ruin; that her\\nmother had been a liar, and worse; and that Lucy was fast following in\\nher steps down to perdition.\\n\\nAs she went on, Lucy, who had seemed stunned at first, lifted up her\\nhead and looked Mrs. Bernard steadily in the face, while her colour\\nrose, and her large black eyes flashed fire.\\n\\n\"Aunt Bernard, you are a wicked woman to speak so of my dear mother,\"\\nsaid she. \"Mamma was a lovely lady; and my father loved her. She is\\nan angel now; and when you call her bad names, it is you that are the\\nliar, and not she.\"\\n\\nAunt Bernard stood as if stunned, for a moment. Then she seized Lucy by\\nthe arm.\\n\\n\"Down on your knees, this moment!\" said she, sternly, and at the same\\ntime trying to force her to kneel. \"Down upon your knees, this moment,\\nand beg my pardon!\"\\n\\n\"I will not!\" returned Lucy, resisting with all her strength. \"I will\\nnever beg your pardon. I hate you, Aunt Bernard, with my whole heart! I\\nwould rather live with the dogs in the parson\\'s kennel than with you.\"\\n\\nAunt Bernard said no more, but, dragging Lucy out of the kitchen, and\\nup the stairs to a disused attic, she thrust her in by main force,\\nand shut the door behind her. The maids could only guess what passed\\nby hearing Lucy\\'s cries and screams. Presently Aunt Bernard came\\ndown-stairs and into the kitchen, expecting to find Anne and Margery in\\na great fright She was mistaken.\\n\\n\"Mistress,\" said old Margery, rising, and standing before her with\\nfolded arms, \"is it your purpose to let that child remain all night in\\nthat desolate chamber?\"\\n\\n\"That is no business of yours, Margery; but, since you ask me, I\\nwill tell you that it is my purpose to keep her a prisoner, and upon\\nprisoners\\' diet, and that of the sparest. She shall neither come out\\nof that room, nor shall she see other food than brown bread and water,\\ntill she kneels to me and begs my pardon,—nor then, unless I see fit to\\ngrant it. I will break that proud spirit, or I will know why. Nay, I\\nwill not hear a word,\" she added, sternly, as she saw Margery preparing\\nto speak. \"You and Anne will find you have done the child little good\\nwith your coddlings and cossetings.\"\\n\\n\"Then, madam,\" said the old woman, not without dignity, \"you will\\nplease suit yourself with another cook. I have served you for many a\\nyear, and did not think to leave you during my life; but I will never\\nstay under a roof where an orphan child is so treated. The day after\\nto-morrow is quarter-day: so you will please suit yourself with a cook.\"\\n\\n\"And with a housemaid also, mistress,\" said Anne. \"\\'Tis well known that\\nan orphan\\'s curse will bring destruction upon the proudest house; and\\nI, for one, have no wish to abide it. Every one knows how the lightning\\nstruck Farmer Dobson\\'s stacks and barns after he turned his wife\\'s poor\\ndaughter out of doors, and what happened to the uncle of the Babes in\\nthe Wood.\"\\n\\nAnne spoke according to the superstitions of the time; nor was Mrs.\\nBernard\\'s mind so free from it that a shudder did not pass over her\\nat the girl\\'s bold words. But she was proud and obstinate,—firm and\\ndignified she called herself. Her own conscience told her that she was\\ncruel and unforgiving,—that she visiting on Lucy\\'s head not so much the\\nchild\\'s fault as her own vexation. But she would not listen. Her evil\\npassions were aroused, and had become her masters.\\n\\n\"You must do as you please,\" said she, coldly. \"I shall doubtless\\nfind other servants in your place easier than you will find other\\nservices,—especially at your age, Margery.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t help that,\" said Anne, tossing her head. \"Better a crust in\\nquietness than a full dish under the curse of the orphan.\"\\n\\n\\nTwo or three days passed on, and nothing was seen of Lucy. She remained\\nshut up in her attic chamber, visited by her aunt or Hannah once a day,\\nwith scanty and coarse provisions. Sometimes the girls, listening,\\nheard her sobbing as if her heart would break, sometimes moaning\\nfaintly; but Mrs. Bernard kept close watch, and they could not get near\\nher.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t stand this any longer,\" said Anne to Margery, the third day.\\n\"The child will die before she will give way, and her blood will be on\\nall our heads. I shall go to Parson Burgess and tell him the story. He\\nis justice as well as parson; and we will see if something cannot be\\ndone.\" *\\n\\n   * In England, the rector, or minister, of a parish is not unfrequently\\na justice also.\\n\\n\"Do,\" said Margery. \"No one can tell whether it will do any good; but\\nthings must not go on as they are. I know my mistress\\'s temper but too\\nwell. It was just such a time as this with Lady Lucy which drove my\\npoor young master to sea, where he perished miserably.\"\\n\\nIt was not long before Anne was at the parson\\'s gate, where she found\\nthe children all assembled, some admiring and feeding with grass the\\ntwo beautiful horses which stood before the door, some watching half\\ntimidly the negro servant who held them, and who was trying to coax\\nthe youngest little girl to come to him. Anne\\'s tale was soon told to\\nPolly, who, as the eldest, was exercising a sort of supervision over\\nthe little ones.\\n\\n\"What a shame!\" exclaimed the warm-hearted girl, as Anne concluded her\\ntale, which lost nothing from her manner of telling it. \"Oh, if my\\nfather were only alone! There is a great gentleman with him, who came\\njust now; and we must not interrupt him.\"\\n\\n\"Tell mother,\" said Dulcie, the second girl: \"mother will know what to\\ndo. And here she comes now.\"\\n\\nMistress Burgess listened to Anne\\'s repetition of the sad tale.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it a shame, mother?\" exclaimed the girls. \"Poor little Lady\\nLucy!\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure you are telling the truth, my girl?\" asked Mistress\\nBurgess, bending her mild, penetrating eyes on Anne\\'s face, and hushing\\nwith an upraised finger the clamours of the children. \"Recollect\\nyourself; for this is a matter of the last importance, and you are come\\nin the nick of time. The gentleman who arrived this morning is Lady\\nLucy\\'s father.\"\\n\\n\"Why, mamma, I thought he was dead long ago!\"\\n\\n\"And so thought every one; but it turns out a mistake. He was wounded\\nand left for dead, and only recovered to find himself in a French\\nprison, where he has languished all these years till just now that he\\nhas been exchanged; not by his own title,—for as Lord Stanton, he had\\nbeen condemned to death, and had only saved his life by taking the name\\nof his servant, who died in his cell. He has known naught of his own\\nfamily,—not even that his poor wife was dead.\"\\n\\nAnne was not a little daunted when she found herself in presence of the\\nparson and his guest, the tall, stately soldier. But she was a girl\\nof spirit, and confident in the goodness of her cause; and she told a\\nsimple, straight-forward story, from which all the cross-questioning of\\nDr. Burgess and Lord Stanton did not cause her to vary an inch.\\n\\n\"I thank you, my girl,\" said Lord Stanton, at last. \"I shall not forget\\nyour services and, meantime, here is a token for you,\" (putting a gold\\npiece in her hand). \"You will please say nothing of this at the Grange\\ntill I come. I wish to see the state of things for myself, and will\\nfollow you directly.\"\\n\\n\"And a nice surprise it will be for my mistress,\" thought Anne, as she\\ncurtsied, and retired, well pleased with her day\\'s work. \"I am sure I\\nwill say nothing to spoil it.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think this girl\\'s tale can be true?\" asked Lord Stanton. \"I\\nknow my sister Bernard for a hard, stern woman, who would have been my\\nlast choice for a guardian; but this seems beyond belief.\"\\n\\n\"Her cousin, Sir James Warden, doubtless acted for the best,\" said\\nDr. Burgess. \"Mrs. Bernard has ever been counted an honourable woman,\\nthough somewhat stern and severe, especially with children. I have\\noften pitied Lady Lucy, and would willingly have made her acquaintance,\\nthat she might amuse herself with companions of her own age; but\\nher aunt has repelled all our advances. It may be that my good wife\\nand myself have erred is the opposite direction, and allowed too\\nmuch liberty to our young flock. I know that Mrs. Bernard is of that\\nopinion,—which probably is one reason that she will not allow Lady Lucy\\nto play with my girls, but I cannot think children spoiled who mind\\ntheir mother with a word or look, and come to their parents with all\\ntheir little secrets and confessions as freely as our young ones.\"\\n\\n\"Truly I should say not,\" returned Lord Stanton. \"But I am impatient to\\nsee my poor little daughter. May I so far trespass upon your kindness\\nas to ask Mrs. Burgess to take charge of her for a day or two till I\\ncan make arrangements for keeping her at home?\"\\n\\n\"Surely, surely, my lord,—if she can live as we do. I will mention the\\nmatter to my wife.\"\\n\\n\\nPoor Lucy, on her hard bed, had fallen into an uneasy slumber, while\\nher bread and water stood almost untouched upon the table. The three\\ndays of confinement and harsh treatment had made a great change in her\\nappearance. She was thinner and paler, with dark purple marks under her\\neyes; and the scarlet traces of the blows she had received still showed\\nplainly upon her thin white neck and arms. She had seen from the window\\nher aunt go out for a walk, as usual, in the cool of the day, and had\\nwaited, watching and hoping that Anne or Margery would find a chance to\\nspeak to her through the key-hole, if no more. But no one came, and she\\nhad cried herself to sleep.\\n\\nShe was suddenly awakened by the sound of several voices upon the\\nstairs. She distinguished Anne\\'s, and then Hannah\\'s, and then a stern,\\nmanly voice, which said,—\\n\\n\"If you do not open the door without delay, I will break it in. I will\\nnot be kept from my child.\"\\n\\nThen the door was unlocked, and she saw Anne and Margery, Hannah,\\nlooking frightened and angry, and a tall, richly-dressed gentleman,\\nwhom she seemed directly to remember, and who caught her in his arms,\\ncalling her his darling, his poor, motherless, abused child.\\n\\n\"Are you really my father,—my own father who was dead?\" she asked, at\\nlast, and leaning back to look at him.\\n\\n\"I am your own father, child, counted dead for so many years.\"\\n\\n\"And is mamma come alive again too?\"\\n\\nLucy felt herself drawn into a closer embrace as her father whispered,—\\n\\n\"No, dear child: your precious mother cannot come again; but we shall\\ngo to her.\"\\n\\n\"And will you take me away and let me live with you?\" asked Lucy. \"Oh,\\npapa, I will try to be so very good, if you will!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Lucy: you shall go with me this very night. Mistress Burgess will\\nreceive you.\"\\n\\n\"The child must not be removed till my mistress returns,\" said Hannah,\\ntartly. \"Her guardian put her in my mistress\\'s care; and to him she is\\nanswerable,—not to a stranger.\"\\n\\nLord Stanton rose.\\n\\n\"She shall be removed without one moment\\'s delay,\" said he, firmly.\\n\"I am her father. Let some one—you, my girl—\" as he saw Anne—\"bring\\nsomething in which to wrap her. I will answer to my sister for what I\\ndo. Whether she can answer to me, is another matter.\"\\n\\n\\nMrs. Bernard, returning from her walk, saw the servants and horses\\nstanding at Dr. Burgess\\'s door; but she thought nothing of it, except\\nto wonder what grand visitor had come to the parson\\'s. Her meditations\\nhad not been very pleasant. She was beginning to get over her fit of\\nanger, and to listen to two counsellors,—conscience and interest; and\\nfrom neither of them did she obtain a great deal of comfort.\\n\\nConscience told her that she had given way to passion; that she had\\nbeen harsh and cruel to a helpless child; that she had failed in her\\ntrust, and had roused, in the usually timid and yielding girl, pride\\nand obstinacy equal to her own.\\n\\nInterest told her that she had made an enemy of Lucy; that she had\\nfailed to win the child\\'s affection or confidence; that she had no hold\\nupon her but sheer physical force. Sir James Warden, Lucy\\'s cousin and\\nguardian, might see fit to remove her at any time; and no doubt Lucy\\nwould look upon change as for the better. The child herself would be\\nno great loss; but with her would go the three hundred pounds a year\\nallowed for her guardianship, and with that the carriage, the extra\\nservants, perhaps the very house in which she lived and which belonged\\nto the Stanton-Corbet estate.\\n\\nShe had no claim upon the property save what grew out of her care of\\nLucy. She was the daughter of Lord Stanton\\'s step-mother, and had been\\nbrought up with him: that was all the relationship. It would have been\\nthe part of wisdom, interest told her, to have acquired such a hold\\nupon the little girl\\'s regards as would have given her a lifelong\\ninfluence over the young heiress. Instead of that, she had allowed her\\nhatred of her step-brother\\'s foreign wife to cause her to tyrannize\\nover his daughter.\\n\\nLucy had never loved her, and she had long since lost even the slight\\nhold upon her respect which she had once possessed. It was probably\\ntoo late to mend matters now, even if her pride would have allowed her\\nto stoop to a child; but Mrs. Bernard resolved that Lucy should be\\nforgiven and released as if she had actually begged pardon, and that\\nhenceforth she would allow her more liberty.\\n\\nIn this frame of mind she came home, to be met by the news that Lucy\\'s\\nfather had returned and carried her away, leaving a note to explain his\\nproceedings. What this note contained no one ever knew.\\n\\nMrs. Bernard read it and crushed it up in her hand without any remark.\\nThen she bade Hannah pack Lady Lucy\\'s clothes and other possessions and\\nsend them to the parsonage. She had all but idolized her step-brother,\\nand had shed many tears for his loss; but she took no steps to see him,\\nnor did she ever again mention his name. She continued for many years\\nliving in the same house, seeing no company, never going out even to\\nchurch, and refusing to speak to any member of Dr. Burgess\\'s family if\\nby any chance she met them.\\n\\nShe had indulged pride and self-will till they had become absorbing\\npassions over which she exerted no control. Some time after, Lady Lucy\\nmade more than one effort to see and conciliate her aunt; but Mrs.\\nBernard sternly repelled all her advances, and lived and died alone.\\n\\n\\nMeantime, Lady Lucy was most warmly received at the parsonage,\\ninstalled in the best room, and treated with all the care and kindness\\nwhich Mrs. Burgess and her daughters had to bestow, till her father\\ncame to carry her home to Stanton Court, where he had engaged an\\nelderly lady—a cousin of his mother—to take care of her. Lord Stanton\\nstayed a few days with Lucy, and then went abroad once more, leaving\\nhis daughter to the care of Cousin Deborah Corbet.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nLUCY had been about five weeks under the charge of Cousin Deborah at\\nthe time our story begins,—weeks so quiet and happy, so free from care\\nand fault-finding, that the little girl sometimes wondered whether she\\nwere living in the same world. Nothing seemed the same about her but\\nAnne, who had come from the Grange to live at Stanton Court and attend\\nupon Lady Lucy.\\n\\nCousin Deborah, for her part, would have preferred to do without Anne.\\nShe foresaw that Lucy would have formed undesirable and wrong habits\\nunder such a rule as that of Aunt Bernard, and she thought it would be\\nmore easy to break up these habits if the little girl had no one about\\nher but such persons as she knew and could trust. But Anne\\'s services\\nhad been too important to go unrewarded: she had lost her place from\\nher devotion to Lady Lucy\\'s interests, and she was devotedly attached\\nto the child: so Cousin Deborah resolved to make the best of it.\\n\\nIt may easily be guessed that Anne was not at all unwilling to\\naccompany Lady Lucy, or to exchange the close housekeeping of the\\nGrange for the liberality of Stanton Court. Margery might have come,\\ntoo, and both Lady Lucy and Anne begged her to do so; but Margery\\nrefused.\\n\\n\"I am not going to leave my old mistress, now that she is in trouble\\nand disgrace,\" said she. \"I shall stay and stand by her. She will\\nfind it hard to suit herself, with all these stories flying about the\\ncountry. She is growing infirm in body and, I believe, in mind; and I\\nwill not leave her with no one about her whom she can trust but Hannah.\"\\n\\nThe stories to which Margery referred were exaggerated and distorted\\naccounts of her mistress\\'s treatment of Lady Lucy. The maids at the\\nparsonage had gossiped, of course, as well as the milkmaid at the\\nGrange. Every one in the village knew that Lady Lucy\\'s father had found\\nhis daughter locked in an upper room alone, with nothing to eat but\\na crust of brown bread,—some said, not even that,—and had taken her\\naway without seeing his sister or waiting for his child\\'s clothes to\\nbe packed up. This was a fine nucleus for the story, which grew, like\\na snowball, every time it was turned over, till many people actually\\nbelieved that Mrs. Bernard had gone deliberately to work to kill her\\nniece by cruelty, that she might have the use of her property.\\n\\n\"I am sure it is no more than she deserves,\" said Anne, tossing her\\nhead.\\n\\n\"Perhaps so; but, Anne, if we come to talk of deserts, where should any\\nof us be?\"\\n\\n\"She has got Hannah,\" said Anne.\\n\\n\"Yes; and that is another reason for my staying. I don\\'t trust Hannah.\\nNo, Anne: I love Lady Lucy, but I shall not leave Mrs. Bernard. Her\\nhusband was kind to mine when he needed kindness; her son was my\\nfoster-child, and dear to me as my own; and, for their sakes as well as\\nhers, I shall stay.\"\\n\\nAnd so Margery stayed; and, when Hannah left, she became in time the\\nsole servant in the lonely, deserted Grange House, where Mrs. Bernard\\nwore her life away in bitter recollections, with nothing to sustain her\\nbut her own pride and resentment.\\n\\nLucy had learned no lessons, nor performed any tasks, as she was\\naccustomed to call them, since she came to Stanton Court. She had\\nsuffered greatly in health under Aunt Bernard\\'s discipline, and\\nespecially under the last shock. She was timid, nervous, and depressed,\\nafraid to speak, afraid to make a natural motion in presence of her\\nelders, unable to imagine that any one could be kind to her or love her\\nexcept Anne. She slept badly, and awoke feverish and without appetite;\\nshe was very soon tired with any exertion; and she had all the time a\\nlittle, hard cough.\\n\\nCousin Debby was used to children. She had brought up six girls of her\\nown, all of whom she had nursed through a somewhat delicate and sickly\\nchildhood, to be women of at least average health and strength. She saw\\nthat of lessons Lucy had lately had more than enough; and she wisely\\nconcluded that Lucy\\'s health and spirits were to be cultivated, even at\\nthe expense of her present improvement in knowledge.\\n\\n\"A great many women get through the world pretty well without knowing\\nmuch either of books or music,\" said she to her cousin, Lord Stanton;\\n\"but weak backs and nerves, and fits of vapours and hysterics, unfit a\\nwoman for any usefulness whatever. The child has been overworked, and\\nneeds rest.\"\\n\\nAnd Lord Stanton had agreed with Cousin Deborah, and had bid her take\\nher own course with Lucy. So, for the first few weeks, Lucy did little\\nbut run about the garden and grounds, and take rides on the donkey,\\nwith Cousin Debby walking by her side. But this morning Cousin Debby\\nhad decided she should begin some lessons again. So Lucy had learned a\\nspelling-lesson, and practised on her lute for half an hour, and was\\nnow to do her task of sewing.\\n\\n\"What sort of work have you done most of?\" asked Cousin Debby.\\n\\n\"Embroidery, and open-hem, and marking, and fine darning,\" said Lucy;\\n\"and oh, Cousin Debby, how I hate them all!\"\\n\\nLucy looked scared as soon as she had said the words. Such a speech\\nmade in Aunt Bernard\\'s hearing would have insured her an hour\\'s\\nadditional work, if not a slap from the fan handle across her fingers;\\nbut Cousin Debby only smiled. She was glad to see that Lucy was\\nbeginning to feel a little freedom with her.\\n\\n\"Suppose, then, we try something else,\" said she. \"The poor woman who\\nlives at the porter\\'s lodge has a pair of twins, born this morning; and\\nshe is but poorly provided with clothes for them. Suppose I cut out a\\nflannel petticoat for one of them and show you how to make it?\"\\n\\n\"I shall like that,\" said Lucy. \"Dolly Burgess used to do things for\\npoor people, I know. And please, cousin, do you think I might carry it\\nto her myself? I should so like to see a little baby near by.\"\\n\\n\"You shall carry it to the baby yourself certainly,\" said Cousin Debby,\\nsmiling; \"and you shall go with me this afternoon, when your sewing is\\ndone, to take the poor woman some broth which cook is making for her.\\nSo now be industrious, and see how much you will accomplish while I am\\ngone. Have you a work-box of your own?\"\\n\\n\"No, cousin: I kept my working-things in a corner of Aunt Bernard\\'s\\ntable-drawer.\"\\n\\nCousin Debby took a bunch of keys from the little basket of keys which\\nhung at her side, and, opening a tall cabinet which stood at one side\\nof the fireplace, she took out a beautiful box. The sides were formed\\nof ivory, inlaid with many curious figures in a black wood, which\\nCousin Debby told Lucy was ebony. She set the box on the little table\\nin the bow-window where Lucy was sitting, and unlocked it by the little\\ngold key which hung to the handle.\\n\\nLucy uttered an exclamation of delight. There were scissors and knives\\nof various kinds, with gold and enamelled handles; there were bobbins,\\ntooth-picks, and stilettos, and more other implements than you can\\nmention, all ornamented in the same way, and a beautiful little crystal\\nbottle of attar of roses, which still retained its perfume.\\n\\n\"This was your dear mother\\'s work-box,\" said Cousin Debby; \"and some\\nday it shall be yours.\"\\n\\n\"When?\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n\"When I see whether you are careful enough to be trusted with such\\nvaluable things,\" answered Cousin Debby. \"You may keep it here upon the\\ntable, if you please, and lay your own thimble and scissors in this\\nvacant place. I suppose your mother\\'s thimble will be too large for\\nyou. Try it on.\"\\n\\nLucy slipped her finger into it.\\n\\n\"It is too large but I can wear it,\" said she. \"Please let me use it\\nthis morning, Cousin Debby.\"\\n\\n\"No, not this morning. You might lose it; and, besides, there is a hole\\nin it, which needs mending. I will send it to Exeter, when I can, and\\nhave it repaired and made a little smaller. Now go at your work; and if\\nyou have finished it by the time I come down, we will go to the lodge\\nand see the little twins.\"\\n\\n\"What are you going to do, Cousin Debby?\"\\n\\n\"I am going into the green chamber, to look over some drawers.\"\\n\\nLeft to herself, Lucy worked very industriously for half an hour. She\\nkept the work-box open before her, and now and then she glanced at the\\ncontents. But Lucy was not used to working without being over-looked;\\nand she had never been trusted in all her life.\\n\\nPresently she dropped her work in her lap, and began to take out the\\narticles in the work-box one by one and lay them upon the table.\\n\\nAt last she put on the thimble and began sewing with it. She took a\\nfew stitches with great satisfaction,—when all at once the eye of\\nthe needle found out the hole in the top of the thimble, and entered\\npretty deeply under Lucy\\'s finger-nail. Now, there are few things more\\nprovocative of hasty action than a prick under the nails. Lucy dropped\\nher work and gave her hand a sudden shake,—when off flew the thimble\\nthrough the long window which opened to the terrace.\\n\\nAt the same moment she heard Cousin Debby coming down-stairs, stopping\\non the landing to talk with the housemaid. Hastily restoring the other\\narticles to their places, Lucy peeped out to see what had become of the\\nthimble. There it lay, just under one of the low flower-vases which\\nadorned the terrace, half hidden under a broad-leaved plant which grew\\nthere. Lucy could see it plainly, and was just going to step out of the\\nwindow to recover it, when Cousin Debby came out at the hall door and\\nalong towards the bow-window.\\n\\nHastily Lucy shrank back, and resumed her work, her fingers trembling\\nand her heart sick with fear. Cousin Debby would no doubt see the\\nthimble, and then all would be over.\\n\\n\"Well, Lucy, how has the work progressed?\" asked Cousin Debby, pausing\\nbefore the open window.\\n\\n\"Not very well,\" said Lucy, trying to speak quietly. \"I pricked my\\nfinger, and I had to stop and wait for it to be done bleeding.\"\\n\\n\"Let me see,\" said Cousin Debby. \"Why, that is a deep prick! You\\nhad better not sew any more just now, lest it should inflame and be\\ntroublesome. Run and get your hood, and we will walk down to the lodge.\"\\n\\nLucy\\'s heart sank deeper still; but she dared not disobey. The best way\\nwould have been to tell the plain truth and pick up the thimble openly;\\nbut this she dared not do. She had been so severely treated for the\\nleast fault, that she had learned the habit of concealing every thing.\\nShe went up-stairs and put on her hood, expecting all the time to hear\\nher name sharply called and feel her poor little fingers and arms\\ntingle and burn from the application of a whalebone or ratan. Nothing\\nof the sort happened, however.\\n\\nWhen she came down, Cousin Debby was standing talking with the old\\ngardener about some plants.\\n\\n\"You will be sure and remember, Robbins?\" said she.\\n\\n\"Yes, madam,—oh, yes: I never forgets any thing,\" said Robbins.\\n\\n\"I dare say he will never think of it again,\" said Cousin Debby, as\\nthey walked away. \"The poor old man grows more and more forgetful every\\nday.\"\\n\\nLucy had a pleasant walk, and enjoyed very much seeing the dear little\\nbabies and holding one of them in her arms. The good woman lamented her\\nwant of baby-clothes; and Cousin Debby promised to see what she could\\nfind for them.\\n\\n\"You did not tell her that I was making a petticoat for the baby,\" Lucy\\nventured to observe, as they left the lodge to return home.\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Cousin Debby: \"I thought it better to wait till the\\npetticoat was finished. Something might happen to prevent your sewing,\\nor you might be wanting in perseverance and then the poor woman would\\nbe disappointed. Do you know the meaning of \\'perseverance\\'?\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\n\"Why do you not ask, then?\"\\n\\n\"Aunt Bernard would never let me ask questions,\" replied Lucy. \"She\\nsaid it was not proper.\"\\n\\n\"There are times when it is not proper for little girls to ask\\nquestions,\" said Cousin Debby,—\"as, for instance, in company, or when\\nthey interrupt their elders by so doing. But, Lucy, I want you always\\nto feel free to ask me any questions you please when we are alone\\ntogether. I may not always see fit to answer you; but I shall never be\\ndispleased at your asking, so that you do it in a proper spirit.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean by a proper spirit?\" Lucy ventured to inquire.\\n\\n\"Perhaps I can illustrate the matter best by telling you what is not a\\nproper spirit. If I should tell you it was time to go to bed, and you\\nshould ask, in a fretful tone, \\'Why must I go to bed now? Why cannot\\nI sit up as long as you do?\\' That would be an improper spirit. But if\\nyou should obey directly, and should then ask, \\'Why must little girls\\ngo to bed earlier than grown-up people?\\' because you wished to know the\\nreason, I should then be ready to tell you all I know about the matter.\\n\\n\"Sometimes children ask impertinent questions,—as if you were to see\\nme reading a letter and should ask whom it was from. Sometimes, too,\\nthey ask silly and troublesome questions, just to hear themselves\\ntalk,—which is a very disagreeable habit.\\n\\n\"Your asking the meaning of the word \\'perseverance\\' would be a proper\\nquestion; and I am very glad to answer it. To persevere in any thing\\nyou undertake to do is to keep at it till it is finished. If you work\\nsteadily at the baby\\'s petticoat at all proper times till it is done,\\nyou will persevere. Now do you understand?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am,\" replied Lucy. \"I think it is pleasant to understand.\"\\n\\nAll this time the thought of the thimble was in Lucy\\'s mind, lying\\nunder all her other thoughts, as a stone lies under a running stream.\\nIt did not make her so unhappy as it ought to have done; for,\\nunluckily, Lucy was used to having such concealments and to hiding her\\nfaults as long as possible. She was not miserable at the thought that\\nshe had disobeyed and deceived her cousin: she only thought how she\\nwould be punished if the thimble were lost.\\n\\nAunt Bernard had never taught her to exercise her conscience—to do\\nthings because they were right, or refrain from them because they were\\nwrong. But she felt in a great hurry to get back to the Hall, in order\\nthat she might find the thimble and restore it to its place before it\\nwas missed.\\n\\nShe was, therefore, not very well pleased when Cousin Debby said that,\\nas the day was cool, they would walk to the village and call upon the\\nrector\\'s family, adding, \"You will be glad to see Polly and Dulcie\\nagain; and, as little Willy Mattison is here, we will send him to bring\\ndown the donkey, that you may ride back.\"\\n\\nLucy would much rather have gone home; but she dared not object. She\\ncould not see any way to help herself: so she put the thought of the\\nthimble as far away as she could, and resolved to make the best of\\nmatters.\\n\\nThe village church and parsonage lay about a mile from Stanton Court,\\nand the walk to it was a lovely one,—through the woods, and along the\\nbanks of that very stream by which Lucy had stolen away to feed the\\nswans. Now and then they passed a tiny waterfall; and more than once a\\nlovely little spring came dripping down the rock, and collected in a\\nlittle basin before it ran into the brook. On a stone by one of these\\nsprings sat a square wooden cup, roughly hewn out of a piece of hard\\nwood; and here they stopped to drink. Cousin Debby knew the names of\\nmany of the plants, and the ways and habits of the birds and insects,\\nand she told Lucy many interesting tales of their doings and customs.\\nIt would have been a very delightful walk if it had not been for that\\nunlucky thimble and, even as it was, Lucy enjoyed it greatly, as well\\nas the visit which followed.\\n\\nPolly and Dulcie were strong, healthy, high-spirited girls, and, with\\ntheir warm hearts and truthful ways, were as good companions as could\\nbe found for the poor, crushed, reserved little lady. So Cousin Debby\\nthought; and she resolved to encourage a friendship between them. They\\ngave Lucy a warm welcome, and did their best to entertain her,—showing\\nher their gardens, the grotto which they were ornamenting with\\nshell-work after the fashion of the time, and finally took her into the\\nmeadow, to show her Polly\\'s little hornless cow, which was as tame and\\nalmost as playful as a kitten. Lucy looked across the stream into her\\naunt\\'s garden, and up at the house where she had spent so many dreary\\nhours, with a feeling of wonder.\\n\\n\"There is Mrs. Bernard now, walking on the green,\" said Polly. \"Poor\\nlady, how lonely she must be! I can\\'t help feeling sorry for her, after\\nall.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t feel sorry for her,\" said Lucy, under her breath. \"I hate her;\\nand I should like to see her served just as she served me.\"\\n\\nLucy said these words with all energy which showed that she was\\nthoroughly in earnest, and which made the gentle little Dulcie look up\\nwith surprise and horror.\\n\\n\"Oh, Lady Lucy, you should not feel so! It is not right. If she has\\ntreated you ever so bad, you ought to forgive her.\"\\n\\n\"Aunt Bernard never forgave me or anybody,\" returned Lucy. \"She said\\nonce that she never forgave or forgot; and I have heard Margery say\\nthat she would never answer her own son\\'s letter, when he wrote begging\\nher pardon for running away to sea.\"\\n\\n\"Then she is a wicked woman, and you should not try to be like her,\"\\nsaid plain-spoken Polly.\\n\\n\"Aunt Bernard said God hated sinners,\" persisted Lucy. \"She said he\\nhated me.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe that,\" said Polly. \"I mean to ask my father. Anyway,\\nLady Lucy, it was not much like hating you when God brought back your\\nfather from the prison and gave you such a nice home and such a nice\\nlady to take care of you.\"\\n\\nLucy looked puzzled. \"Did he do that? I never thought of that.\"\\n\\n\"Of course he did. He gives us all things. That is the reason we call\\nhim our Father, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"I never thought of that,\" said Lucy, again. \"I thought he was like a\\ngreat king, who sat up in heaven and did not care what happened, only\\nto punish people when they do wrong. I never thought of his being any\\nthing like my father.\"\\n\\n\"You ought to think so; and you ought to love him, too,\" said Polly.\\n\"The catechism says our duty towards God is to love him with all our\\nmight; and it is in the Bible, too. And I am sure you ought to forgive\\nMrs. Bernard.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" returned Lucy. \"You don\\'t know how she treated me, Polly.\"\\n\\n\"I know she was shamefully cruel to you; but, Lady Lucy,\" added Polly,\\nreverently, \"you know she could not treat you so ill as our Lord was\\ntreated; and he forgave all his enemies, even on the cross. And,\\nbesides, you know God will not forgive you unless you forgive your\\naunt.\"\\n\\n\"It don\\'t seem as if I could,\" said Lucy; and she looked again at\\nthe stately figure of Aunt Bernard, as she passed and repassed the\\narchway in the holly hedges. \"Oh, she was so hard,—so hard upon me!\"\\nshe repeated, bitterly. \"She never let me be happy one minute, if she\\ncould help it. And she abused my mamma. She called her a liar and an\\noutlandish witch. No, Polly: I can\\'t. I do hate her, and I always\\nshall.\"\\n\\n\"But, Lady Lucy, what will become of you when you die, if you go on\\nso?\" argued Dulcie. \"You know you cannot go to heaven unless you do\\nforgive your enemies and are in charity with all men; and you know your\\nmamma is in heaven,\" she added, in a low voice.\\n\\n\"And you cannot go to heaven unless God forgives you, either,\" added\\nPolly. \"You know we all do a great many wrong things, that need to be\\nforgiven.\"\\n\\nLucy thought of the thimble lying under the aloe-leaf on the terrace.\\n\"Don\\'t talk about it any more,\" said she, abruptly. \"See, there is your\\nmother calling us. I dare say Cousin Debby is ready to go home.\"\\n\\nBut Cousin Debby was not quite ready. Mrs. Burgess, in her hospitable\\nkindness, would by no means allow them to depart without refreshment.\\nThe table was most invitingly set out in the great, cool parlour,—the\\nparsonage had no other rooms below than the parlour and kitchen, and a\\nroom behind, which served the doctor for a study,—and Cousin Deborah\\nand Lady Lucy must eat curds and cream and apricots and seed-cake and\\ndrink each a glass of gooseberry wine.\\n\\nWhile they were chatting around the table, a shower came up, and Cousin\\nDeborah concluded to wait until it was over. The weather partly cleared\\nup towards evening, and they set out for home. But, before they reached\\nStanton Court, the rain poured down again, and they arrived at home wet\\nto the skin.\\n\\nAnne hurried Lucy off to bed, dosing her with warm gruel, lest she\\nshould take cold: so, of course, all chance of searching for the\\nthimble was out of the question.\\n\\nThe next morning, before her cousin was dressed, Lucy ran down-stairs\\nand out upon the terrace. Breathlessly she hurried to the flower-pots\\nopposite the bow-window, and lifted the broad leaves one after the\\nother.\\n\\nThe thimble was not there.\\n\\nShe stood bewildered for a moment, when it suddenly flashed across her\\nmind that some one might have found it and put it away.\\n\\nShe hurried to the parlour. No: it was not in the box. It was lost!\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\"WHAT are you doing with the box, Lucy, my dear?\" asked Cousin Debby,\\nopening the door.\\n\\n\"I—I was looking to see whether I put my thimble away.\" Lucy had given\\na guilty start, and stammered so, as she spoke, that any other child\\nwould have been at once suspected of lying.\\n\\nBut she was always so timid and frightened that Cousin Debby did not\\nthink of any thing being the matter, except that Lucy had been in doubt\\nabout her thimble.\\n\\n\"Did you think you had lost it, then?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"I could not be sure. I did not remember,\" said Lucy, stammering more\\nand more. \"Please, Cousin Deborah, do not be angry with me.\"\\n\\n\"You poor little dear, how scared you are! You are all in a tremble,\\nand your little face is as white as your kerchief,\" said Cousin\\nDeborah, sitting down, and taking Lucy on her knee. \"Lucy, my child, I\\ndo not wish you ever to be afraid of me, even if you have done wrong.\\nTry to have confidence in me and think that I am your friend.\"\\n\\nLucy did not answer.\\n\\nAnd Cousin Deborah, seeing that she still trembled, thought best to\\ndivert her from her fright.\\n\\n\"See here, my love, your stay-lacing is not fastened, nor your shoes\\nproperly buckled. Your cap and kerchief, too, are soiled, and need\\nchanging; nor do I think these little finger-ends have seen the water\\nthis morning. Did Anne dress you?\"\\n\\n\"No, Cousin Debby: I dressed myself. I did not think it was any harm,\"\\nsaid poor Lucy, who was so used to being blamed, whatever she did, that\\nshe was by no means sure she had not committed a grave offense in being\\nher own dressing-maid.\\n\\n\"There is no harm in that, my child. I am glad to have you learn to do\\nevery thing for yourself; but you must be neat and careful about it,\\nand try always to look like a lady. I suppose, however, you were in a\\ngreat hurry to find your thimble: so I will excuse you this time. Now\\ngo back to your room and make yourself neat, and then we will have\\nprayers.\"\\n\\nAs Lucy went back to her room, she was conscious of a new feeling in\\nregard to what she had done. She had often before been terrified at the\\nconsequences of wrong-doing; but of the action itself she had thought\\nvery little. But now, as she thought of having disobeyed and deceived\\nkind Cousin Deborah, she felt sorry for and ashamed of her sin, as well\\nas alarmed for the punishment she expected to receive whenever the\\nthimble should be missed. And she felt that she should continue to be\\nsorry, even if she were never punished at all.\\n\\n\"Oh, if I could only find it,\" she thought, \"I would never, never be so\\nnaughty again.\"\\n\\nShe made herself as neat as she could, and was just finishing her\\ndressing operations, when Anne entered.\\n\\n\"So, my lady, you are grown an early riser, and very independent, to\\nbe sure,\" said she, not very well pleased. \"How long since you were so\\ngrand?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Anne, you know I always dressed myself at Aunt Bernard\\'s. And\\nCousin Debby says it is a very good thing. But I was in such a hurry\\nthis morning that I forgot to wash my hands or buckle my shoes; and\\nCousin Debby sent me back. Please get me a clean cap, Anne.\"\\n\\n\"Ay, you need one. See how you have tumbled your ruffles by throwing\\nyour cap down anyhow, instead of setting it tidily on the top of a\\nchair-post, or some such place. What would Mrs. Bernard say to that,\\nthink you?\"\\n\\n\"She would box my ears, I suppose,\" said Lucy: \"so I am very glad she\\nis not here. Don\\'t be cross, please, Anne. I do like you to dress me;\\nbut, you know, I must do as Cousin Debby says.\"\\n\\n\"Of course you must,\" replied Anne, in a mollified tone,—\"and all the\\nmore that she is so good to you. But I can tell you, Lady Lucy, she\\ncan be cruel strict, too. You ought to hear how she talked to Jenny\\nhousemaid because she told her a fib about the linen. She made her cry,\\nI promise you; and she said she could put up with any thing better than\\na lie: so you must be careful, Lady Lucy. But, goodness gracious me,\\nchild! What is the matter, that you turn so pale?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Anne, I have done such a dreadful thing!\" said poor Lucy. \"And I\\nhave told Cousin Debby a lie, too! Oh, what shall I do?\"\\n\\n\"Tell me all about it,\" said Anne. \"I will put a clean tucker in your\\nbodice, meantime.\"\\n\\nLucy related the story, with many injunctions not to tell.\\n\\nAnne listened attentively, and shook her head when it was finished.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a bad business,\" said she. \"I am much afraid you will never see\\nthe thimble again. There was a tramper woman here yesterday, with\\nher child on her back; and she went along the whole length of the\\nterrace,—the impudent beggar! Nothing less would serve her; and I doubt\\nshe has seen the thimble and picked it up. You see, if old Robbins\\nhad found it, he would have brought it back: he would as soon cut his\\nhead off as steal, would Robbins. But it won\\'t do to ask him about it;\\nbecause that would let out the secret.\"\\n\\n\"Then, what shall I do?\" asked Lucy, in a despairing tone. \"As soon as\\never I come to do my task of sewing, the thimble will be missed.\"\\n\\n\"Hark! There is Mrs. Corbet calling you,\" said Anne. \"Go down\\nnow,—there\\'s a dear,—and I will think the matter over and see what can\\nbe done.\"\\n\\n\"You have been a long time,\" said Cousin Deborah. \"What hindered you?\"\\n\\n\"Anne had to sew a new tucker in my bodice,\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Anne must learn to have your things ready beforehand. But never mind,\\nnow. Come and read the psalm.\"\\n\\nIt was rather hard for Lucy to bring her mind to the task, but she did\\nreally wish to please Cousin Deborah: so she took pains, and succeeded\\ntolerably well.\\n\\nCousin Deborah went back and repeated one of the last verses:—\\n\\n   \"\\'If I regard wickedness in my heart, the Lord will not hear me,\\'\"\\nsaid she.\\n\\n\"Do you know what that means, Lucy?\"\\n\\nLucy had never been much accustomed to think about what she read, and\\nshe had no answer ready.\\n\\n\"Let us see if we cannot find a meaning in it,\" said Cousin Deborah.\\n\"How can any one regard wickedness in his heart?\"\\n\\n\"By wanting to do what is wrong, I suppose,\" replied Lucy, after some\\nthought.\\n\\n\"Yes,—by wishing and intending to do what is wrong. If you were to\\npray to God for his blessing, while all the time you were wishing and\\nmeaning to do something wicked, God would not regard your prayer. You\\nwould not have any right to expect it. It would be no reason for his\\nnot hearing you, that you had already done even a very wicked thing,\\nif you were truly sorry for your wickedness and asked your Father in\\nheaven to forgive you for his dear Son\\'s sake. But if you meant to do\\nthe same thing right over again as soon as you had a chance, you could\\nnot expect him to hear you. You know he sees all your thoughts and\\nfeelings, whether you speak them out or not. I can only guess, at the\\nbest, what you are thinking about; but the Lord knows the very thoughts\\nof all our hearts.\"\\n\\nThese words, as you may suppose were any thing but comfortable to poor\\nLucy. She had heard enough of God before,—and more than enough; for\\nAunt Bernard used to frighten her, many a time, by telling her that he\\nwas angry with her and would destroy her. But Cousin Debby spoke in\\na very different way,—as if she feared him and loved him too. Polly\\nBurgess, too, spoke of loving him, and said he was like her own father,\\nonly a great deal better and kinder. He had delivered her dear papa\\nfrom the French prison and brought him safely home to her, and had\\ngiven her dear, good Cousin Debby to take care of her,—so Polly said.\\nAnd she prayed with Cousin Debby every morning and night that God would\\ntake care of papa in the war and bring him safe home again.\\n\\nBut, if what Cousin Debby said was true, what was the use of her\\npraying? She had told several lies about the thimble; and she knew she\\nmeant to tell another and a worse one. She had planned to tell Cousin\\nDebby that the window was left open and the box unlocked, and that the\\nbeggar-woman must have come in and stolen the thimble.\\n\\n\"But I will not say a word about it, unless she asks me; and, anyway,\\nI dare say she did take the thimble from the terrace: so that will be\\npartly true. And I will be just as good as I can be about every thing\\nelse, and I will never tell a lie again after this time.\"\\n\\nSo Lucy resolved; but, somehow, the resolution did not seem to afford\\nher much comfort. She did her lessons unusually well, and received\\ngreat commendation; but Cousin Debby\\'s praises did not give her the\\nsame pleasure that they had done yesterday. Her mind was beginning to\\nopen to the sense of right and wrong, and she felt that she did not\\ndeserve them.\\n\\nThen came the sewing; and Lucy\\'s heart sank as Cousin Debby opened the\\nwork-box.\\n\\nStrangely enough, however, she did not appear to miss the thimble,\\nalthough the little satin-lined compartment where it belonged was\\nplainly empty.\\n\\n\"Now let me see how diligent you can be,\" said she, as she unfolded the\\nlittle petticoat. \"You have done this very neatly, Lucy,—as well as I\\ncould have done it myself. Aunt Bernard must have taken great pains\\nwith your needlework. There are very few girls of your age who can work\\nso neatly. You see you have at least one thing for which to thank her.\"\\n\\nLucy did not feel so very grateful at that moment; but she agreed to\\nall Cousin Debby said, and took up her work, resolved to do her very\\nbest. She hoped Cousin Debby would go away and leave her to herself, as\\nshe did yesterday.\\n\\nBut, instead of doing so, she sat down in the bow-window and occupied\\nherself in darning some beautiful old lace. She told Lucy this lace\\nhad belonged to her grandmother and should some day be hers; and she\\nrelated many interesting anecdotes of this same grandmother, and\\nof other ladies, members of the Stanton and Corbet families, whose\\nportraits hung in the long picture-gallery up-stairs.\\n\\nIn spite of her trouble of mind, Lucy could not help being interested\\nin these tales. And she was surprised, when the clock struck eleven, to\\nfind that she had come to the end of her work.\\n\\n\"See, Cousin Deborah: is not this finished?\" she asked, as she held it\\nup for inspection.\\n\\n\"It is finished, and very nicely, too,\" replied Cousin Deborah, taking\\nthe little garment out of her hand and looking it over. \"I have found\\nseveral other articles which will be useful to the poor woman. And\\nafter dinner, if it is fine, you shall go with Anne and carry them to\\nher; afterwards you may ride as far as the village shop and buy me some\\nneedles and tape. Now go and play a little; and, when you hear the\\nclock strike the half-hour, come in and get ready for dinner.\"\\n\\n\"Where are you going, Cousin Deborah?\" Lucy ventured to ask, as she saw\\nher cousin putting up her own work.\\n\\n\"I am going to my room for a while. Now run away and play.\"\\n\\nLucy was glad to hear that her cousin was going to her room. It was\\nupon the other side of the house, and quite away from the terrace. And\\nLucy resolved that she would improve the opportunity and spend the\\nhalf-hour in one more hunt for the thimble.\\n\\nBut in vain did she search under the leaves of the broad-leaved aloe,\\nscratching her hands sadly with the sharp thorns. Her thimble was\\nclearly not there.\\n\\n\\n\"How did you scratch your hands so, my dear?\" asked Cousin Deborah,\\nwhen Lucy came down to dinner.\\n\\n\"I was looking at a bird\\'s nest in the holly-bush, Cousin Debby,\"\\nreplied Lucy, in a low voice.\\n\\n\"You are quite sure you have not been at the gooseberry-bushes, Lucy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am. I have not been near them.\" Lucy was telling the truth\\nthis time, and spoke in tolerably steady tones but her conscience\\nreproached her at the very moment, for she knew she had told another\\nlie, in spite of all her resolutions. The rapid multiplication of lies\\nhas long been proverbial.\\n\\nPeople in those days dined early: so that twelve was a fashionable\\nhour. It was not quite noon when Cousin Debby and Lucy sat down to\\ndinner.\\n\\nLucy had all her life been limited and scrimped as to her food. Aunt\\nBernard\\'s housekeeping was far from liberal, at the best. True, she had\\nalways some sort of meat for dinner; but of this Lucy seldom got more\\nthan a very small taste, and right glad was she to be helped to enough\\nof the batter-pudding, or dumpling cooked with the meat, to stay her\\nhunger. Of tart, pudding, or any thing of that sort, she never tasted\\nsave by stealth when Margery or Anne would smuggle away a bit for her.\\n\\nBut Cousin Debby had very different notions. She helped Lucy liberally\\nto the excellent roast-beef, and afterwards gave her a whole custard.\\nNor did she season these dainties with constant reproofs, or count\\nevery mouthful and accuse the child of gluttony because she had a good\\nappetite. On the contrary, she smiled to see Lucy\\'s plate emptied the\\nsecond time, and said she was glad to see her enjoy her dinner.\\n\\n\"Think, Lucy, who it is that has given you all these good things,\" said\\nCousin Deborah, \"and then your returning thanks will not be mere empty,\\nformal words.\"\\n\\nAs Lucy stood up and repeated her \"grace after meat,\" a good old custom\\nwhich seems to have gone quite out of fashion, she thought, \"He gave me\\nthis nice dinner, too. I do wish I could be good, when he is so good to\\nme!\"\\n\\nOften had Lucy been required to say those words when the whole\\ndinner-hour had been one of misery to her,—when she had nothing, as it\\nseemed to her, to be thankful for but sharp words, hard crusts, and\\nharder raps from Aunt Bernard\\'s knife or fan handle,—when her heart was\\nbursting with a sense of oppression and unkindness. Then she had never\\nthought of their meaning, but only how to say them so that she should\\nnot earn another red ridge upon her neck or arms.\\n\\nNow she thought of their sense, and really felt thankful to God for the\\nnice meal and the love which seasoned it. But still that verse recurred\\nto her mind:\\n\\n   \"\\'If I regard wickedness in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Now you may read to me a while; and after that, you and Anne can set\\nout upon your expedition. I believe I will not go out to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you feel well, Cousin Deborah?\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear; but I am somewhat tired. I am an old woman, you know,\\nand cannot run about all day without being fatigued, as you young folks\\ndo.\"\\n\\n\"Are you really old, Cousin Debby?\" asked Lucy, timidly.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear: I am past sixty years old. I can just remember the day\\nwhen King Charles the First was put to death; and I shall never forget\\nthe day that his son, Charles the Second, entered London after his\\nrestoration. I saw the long procession, and all the shows, and the\\nfeasts and bonfires in the streets. And I well remember the dreadful\\ndays of the great plague: though we did not live in London then, but\\nsome miles distant.\"\\n\\n\"Please, Cousin Deborah, I wish you would tell me some stories about\\nthose times,\" Lucy ventured to say. \"It is so much nicer than reading\\nthem out of the history books.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Cousin Deborah, smiling, \"you certainly pay me a high\\ncompliment.\"\\n\\n\"It was not a compliment,\" said Lucy. \"It was true.\"\\n\\n\"Compliments may be true as well as false, Lucy. But I will make a\\nbargain with you. I will tell you stories for half an hour after\\ndinner, provided you will work at the same time.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Lucy, with great satisfaction. \"What shall I do?\"\\n\\n\"Suppose you begin to knit a pair of nice warm woollen stockings for\\npoor Dame Higgins at the almshouse, whose hands are crippled by the\\nrheumatism. You can easily have them ready against winter. I have\\nplenty of good strong worsted.\"\\n\\n\"I shall like that,\" said Lucy. \"It is so much nicer to think that I\\nam working for people than just to work, work, stitch, stitch, without\\never knowing what one is working for.\"\\n\\n\"I agree with you, Lucy. But you must be faithful in fulfilling your\\npart of the bargain, or I shall consider myself released from mine.\"\\n\\nThe stocking was soon set up, and Lucy worked for an hour without once\\nlooking at the clock to see what time it was, while Cousin Deborah told\\nher tales of the great civil war, which she had heard from her father\\nand mother.\\n\\n\"Now you may go and get ready for your ride,\" said Cousin Deborah. \"You\\nwill find the bundle of baby-linen upon my table, and cook Will give\\nyou some biscuit to carry to the poor woman. After you have been at the\\nlodge, you may ride down to the shop and buy me a paper of needles,\\nand two sticks of bobbin like the bit which is tied round the bundle.\\nTake that for a sample; and here is sixpence, which you may spend for\\nyourself, if you please. I dare say you and Anne will be glad of a cake\\napiece at the end of your journey.\"\\n\\n\"How good you are, Cousin Debby!\" exclaimed Lucy. \"You just seem to let\\nme do things because I like them. I do love you dearly!\"\\n\\nAnd Lucy threw her arms round her cousin\\'s neck and kissed her\\nheartily. She had never yet kissed Aunt Bernard of her own accord. \"Oh,\\nhow I do wish I could be a good girl!\"\\n\\n\"Why, I think you are a tolerably good girl, as little girls go,\" said\\nCousin Deborah, returning the kiss, \"though doubtless there is much\\nroom for improvement still. I find that the case with myself; and I\\nhave been trying to be a good girl a much longer time than you have.\\nBut, Lucy,\" she added, seriously, detaining the little girl a moment,\\n\"if you really wish to be good, you must ask the help of your heavenly\\nFather to make you so. Ask him to put his Spirit in your heart and\\nmake you love him. That is the only way to be good and happy, in this\\nworld or the next. Now go and take your ride, and see how many pleasant\\nthings you will have to tell me when you come home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe any one in the world is so good as my cousin Deborah,\"\\nsaid Lucy to Anne.\\n\\nLucy was mounted on her good, patient little donkey, and, with Anne at\\nher side, was riding down the avenue towards the lodge beside the great\\ngate. The old trees, of which there was a double row on each side, met\\nover her head; and the rooks, which had had their nests for a hundred\\nyears and more in the great elms, were apparently giving a great deal\\nof good advice to their young ones in the branches. On either side\\nstretched the park; and Lucy could see the deer resting in the fern, or\\nbounding away as they approached. It was a lovely afternoon in August:\\nthe air was full of pleasant sounds and scents; and everywhere Lucy\\'s\\neyes rested upon something beautiful.\\n\\n\"I do believe my cousin Deborah is the very best and kindest lady in\\nthe whole world,\" repeated Lucy. \"Don\\'t you think so, Anne?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I do not think you will find many better, my lady,\" replied\\nAnne. \"This is not much like the way you were spending the afternoon\\nfive weeks ago this very day. Do you remember how that was?\"\\n\\n\"Why, no,\" said Lucy, considering. \"Oh, yes: I do, indeed,\" she added,\\nshuddering. \"Oh, Anne, how dreadful that was!\"\\n\\n\"And you little thought who was coming to your rescue: did you?\"\\ncontinued Anne. \"I am sure my heart was in my mouth when Madam Burgess\\ntook me into the library, and there sat the parson and that fine\\ngentleman in the gold-laced coat and waistcoat.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure it was very good in you, Anne,\" said Lucy. \"I shall never\\nforget it. But, oh, that unlucky thimble! I would give any thing if it\\nwas found, or if I had never touched it! It makes me feel so ashamed\\nwhen Cousin Deborah praises me, and says and does such kind things!\\nWhen Aunt Bernard scolded me, I did not feel so; I felt vexed and\\nangry, and just like being revenged upon her; but I don\\'t feel so now.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t Mrs. Corbet say any thing about the thimble this morning?\"\\nasked Anne.\\n\\n\"No: I don\\'t think she has missed it yet. But, when she does, what\\nshall I ever do or say?\"\\n\\n\"It, is very unlucky, and that is the truth,\" said Anne. \"I don\\'t doubt\\nthat the beggar-woman got it; or perhaps a magpie spied it and took it\\naway. If we could only find out where it was gone! If there were only\\na wise woman, now, like the one my aunt went to about her mistress\\'s\\nsilver spoons!\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean by a Wise woman, Anne?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, a woman that can tell all sorts of things,—how to cure cattle, and\\nhow to find things that are lost or stolen. There was such a woman in\\nStanton-Corbet once; but Parson Burgess would not let her practise her\\narts there. He said she was a deceiver and an im——— What was the word,\\nnow?\"\\n\\n\"An impostor?\" said Lucy.\\n\\n\"Yes, an impostor. He preached a sermon about it, more by token it\\ndid not do much good, for the people went to her just the same: so,\\nfinally, he drove her away out of the parish.\"\\n\\n\"Did he say it was wicked to go to such people?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I believe so. I was young then, and didn\\'t mind so much about\\nsermons. But here we are at the lodge.\"\\n\\nLucy displayed her treasures, and had the pleasure of seeing one of the\\npretty little twin-girls dressed in the clothes she had brought, and\\nalso of being flattered and praised for her goodness and condescension.\\n\\nTill Anne said,—\"Now, Mary Bolton, don\\'t you be turning the child\\'s\\nhead, and making her think she is an angel all complete, just for such\\na little matter as that. I don\\'t deny, it was kind in my little lady to\\nwork for your baby; but it is no more than she ought to do, seeing how\\nmuch Mrs. Corbet does for her. Come, Lady Lucy; we must be on our way,\\nif we are going to the village.\"\\n\\n\"Are you going across the common?\" asked Mary Bolton. \"You had better\\ntake the path through the plantation, I think. The gipsies on the\\ncommon, and my little lady might be frightened.\"\\n\\n\"Gipsies?\" asked Lucy, looking a little scared.\\n\\n\"Yes; and a wild lot they do look, to be sure. They say the old women\\nare witches; and all the girls in the village are agog to have their\\nfortunes told.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you be scared, Lady Lucy,\" said Anne. \"They won\\'t meddle with\\nus, I dare say. By your leave, Mary Bolton, I would rather go across\\nthe common than the other way. I should not relish meeting any of those\\ngentry in the woods. Betty Henwife will have to look sharp after her\\nfowls, and the gamekeeper for his pheasants, now we have gipsies in the\\nneighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"Anne,\" said Lucy, after they had gone a little way, \"do you suppose\\nthe gipsy-woman could tell me what has become of my mother\\'s thimble?\"\\n\\n\"I was just thinking of that very thing,\" returned Anne. \"I should\\nnot wonder if she could; for they do tell wonderful things,—that is\\ncertain. See, there they are,—tents, donkeys, and all.\"\\n\\nThere they were, forming a picturesque group enough, with their ragged\\ntents pitched under the shade of some old hawthorns, their donkeys and\\nponies tethered near by, and their kettle, boiling, suspended on sticks\\nover the fire, with a tall old woman in a red cloak, just removing the\\ncover and stirring the mess.\\n\\nHalf a dozen half-naked children lay about; and no sooner did they\\ncatch sight of Lucy than up they all jumped and ran towards her and\\nAnne, begging vociferously. Another woman, still taller and older than\\nthe first, came striding towards them.\\n\\nAnd Anne, calling to her, bade her call off the children, and the dogs,\\nwhich were now adding their voices to the chorus.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Lady Lucy\\'s Secret._\\n \"She will cross the old gipsy\\'s hand with silver.\"]\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you be frightened, my pretty little lady,\" said the old woman,\\nin a coaxing voice. \"No one shall hurt my pretty dear. She will cross\\nthe old gipsy\\'s hand with silver, and see what a fine fortune I will\\ntell her.\"\\n\\nLady Lucy and Anne looked at each other.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; I know all about it,\" said the gipsy, nodding in a mysterious\\nmanner. \"I know there is a fine gentleman at the wars whom she loves.\\nAnd I know she has lately escaped from bondage and cruel oppressors,\\nand all that has happened to her since.\"\\n\\nLucy and Anne again exchanged glances of awe and wonder,—both of them\\nforgetting that this gipsy-woman could easily have learned all this\\nfrom the gossip of the village.\\n\\nAnd Lucy half whispered, \"Do you suppose she could tell about the\\nthimble?\"\\n\\nThe gipsy-woman, like many other impostors of her class, had quick ears\\nand quick wits. She caught the word \"thimble,\" and easily guessed that\\nLucy had lost something of that sort.\\n\\n\"I can tell what has happened lately, too,\" she continued, in a\\nmysterious tone. \"I can see what is lost, and where it lies, shining\\nlike silver and gold, fit for a lady\\'s finger when she is working for\\nher true lover. Only cross the poor gipsy\\'s hand with silver, and you\\nshall see. As for you,\" she added, looking at Anne with a penetrating\\nglance, \"you have lately had a rise in life, and shall soon have\\nanother and there is a stout lad abroad at the wars who shall bring\\nhome a gold ring some day.\"\\n\\n\"Just hear that!\" said Anne, turning pale. \"How could she know any\\nthing about John Martin, that went away to the wars with my lord?\"\\n\\nBy this time Lady Lucy and Anne were prepared to believe any nonsense\\nthe gipsy chose to tell them.\\n\\nAnd Lucy whispered, \"Ask her about the thimble.\"\\n\\n\"My lady has lost—\" began Anne.\\n\\nBut the woman cut her short. \"I know; I know. She has lost a thimble.\\nAnd, if she wants to find it, let her come to-morrow to the spring by\\nthe brook, and bring something which has lain by the thimble,—something\\nof silver if it was silver, and of gold if it was gold,—and she shall\\nknow all she desires. But let her beware how she deceives or trifles\\nwith the gipsy-woman, lest she rue the day she saw me under the\\nhawthorn tree.\"\\n\\nTerrified by this threat, all the more alarming from its mystery, and\\nby the frown and glance of the old woman, Lucy tremblingly promised all\\nshe required.\\n\\n\"Must it be something out of the same box?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Yes, out of the same box. Don\\'t fail to let it be of the same metal,\\nor it will do no good. Now, young woman, let me see your hand.\"\\n\\nThe gipsy told Anne a fine fortune, and sent her off greatly pleased.\\nLucy, however, was not so well satisfied. She knew instinctively that\\nCousin Deborah would never let her go to meet the gipsy-woman, and\\nthat she must do so by stealth, if at all. Here was a new labyrinth of\\ndeceit opening upon her.\\n\\n   \"Oh, what a tangled web we weave\\n    When first we practise to deceive!\"\\n\\nThese lines were not written in Lady Lucy\\'s day, or she might have\\nremembered them. She had made a resolution that she would never tell\\nanother lie; but what was to become of that resolution now? And what\\nwas it but stealing, if she took something else out of the box? But,\\nthen, if she did not? Lucy shuddered. She was timid by nature, and\\nstill more by education; and the thought of the gipsy\\'s threats made\\nher tremble and turn cold.\\n\\nIt is to be hoped that almost any little girl of the present day would\\nhave more sense than to be influenced as Lucy was. And yet I am not\\nsure that one could not find both children and grown-up people doing\\nquite as foolish things as going to a gipsy-woman about a lost thimble.\\nIndeed, if there can be said to be any sense in the matter, there\\nwould seem to be two or three grains more in going to a live woman for\\ninformation than in asking a dead table.\\n\\nBut Lucy had never been taught any better: indeed, what teaching she\\nhad ever received on the subject had been the other way.\\n\\nYou may easily see how Lady Lucy was prepared to fall into the snare\\nwhich the gipsy-woman had laid for her. She no more doubted that the\\nwoman could tell where the thimble was, than she doubted that she had\\nlost it. And she felt more and more that she would give any thing she\\nhad to get it into her own possession again: first, because, despite\\nCousin Deborah\\'s kindness, she could not divest herself of the idea\\nthat she should be severely punished if it were known that she had lost\\nit; and secondly, because she could not bear to part with the thimble\\nher dear mamma had used when a little girl like herself.\\n\\nThat the gipsy might impose upon her, or that, even if she found out\\nwhere the thimble was, she might not be able to get it back again, were\\nmatters which she never thought of. Her whole mind was occupied with\\ncontriving how she might get down to the spring to-morrow without the\\nknowledge of Cousin Deborah. And she arrived at home before she had\\ncome to any satisfactory decision.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\"THE post-boy have been here and brought some letters,\" said Jenny, as\\nshe met Lucy in the hall. \"I should not wonder if Mrs. Corbet had news\\nof my lord your father. Anyhow, you were to go to her as soon as you\\ncame in. She is sitting in the library.\"\\n\\nLucy would have found it hard to say whether she were most alarmed or\\ndelighted with this news. She walked very soberly through the gallery,\\nwhere the portraits of all the long-dead Stantons and Corbets hung\\nagainst the wall, with suits of armour and groups of strange weapons\\nsuspended between them, and tapped softly at the half-open library door.\\n\\n\"Come in, my love,\" answered Cousin Deborah\\'s cheery voice, in a tone\\nwhich removed some, at least, of Lucy\\'s fears. \"See, here is a treasure\\nfor you,—a letter from your dear father, and directed to yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Really for me, Cousin Debby?\" asked Lucy, looking at the direction,\\nand then turning the letter over and examining the broad seal. \"I never\\nhad a letter of my own in my life.\"\\n\\n\"Really for you; and I hope you will appreciate your father\\'s goodness\\nin taking so much pains for you. I assure you I was twice—yes, three\\ntimes—as old as you before I ever had a letter of my own. But open it,\\nand let us hear the news. I did not examine it, because I thought you\\nwould like the pleasure of breaking the seal yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Just the way,\" thought Lucy. \"She always thinks of what I shall\\nlike. Oh, how wicked I am! Oh, if I only dared tell her all about the\\nthimble! I wonder if I could? But, then, the gipsy-woman, and those\\nterrible threats. Oh, dear! I never thought I could be so unhappy at\\nStanton Court.\"\\n\\nLucy broke the seal of the letter neatly, as Cousin Deborah showed her\\nhow to do, and opened the broad sheet, which was closely written from\\nend to end.\\n\\n\"Please to read it for me, Cousin Debby. I never can read writing-hand\\nfast.\"\\n\\n\"You must take pains to learn, Lucy. I have some very pretty letters,\\nwhich you can practise upon; but I will read this one to you, if you\\nplease.\"\\n\\nThe letter was dated at the Duke of Marlborough\\'s head-quarters,\\nnear Neuburg, a little place on the river Danube, not very far from\\nIngolstadt. It gave an account of such events of his journey as Lord\\nStanton thought would be interesting to his little daughter.\\n\\n   \"It is generally believed that we are upon the eve of a great and\\ndecisive battle,\" said he; \"though exactly when and how it will take\\nplace, of course, I cannot inform you; but I believe before this letter\\nreaches you, the Duke of Marlborough and his noble ally, Prince Eugene,\\nwill have defeated the army of the French king, under Marshall Tallard,\\nor will have been defeated themselves. The soldiers are in the best\\nof spirits, and full of trust in their great commander, insomuch that\\nno officer thinks of asking the reason of any of his motions, but all\\nfollow him with blind confidence in his wisdom.\\n\\n   \"But let my dear child give God thanks that she lives in a country\\nwhere the horrors of such war are unknown. The sights one sees here\\nare enough to break a man\\'s heart. Smoking ruins which only a few\\ndays since were thriving towns and lovely hamlets; old men, and\\nlittle children, and mothers with infants at their breasts, lying\\ndown to starve at the roadside, or killed by the falling of their\\nown roof-trees; fruitful fields, lately ripening to the harvest, now\\ntrampled and bare: these are but a few of the horrors which constantly\\nmeet one\\'s eyes. I do not suppose this ruin can be helped; but it\\nis indeed hard that such distress and destruction should fall upon\\ninnocent heads, and that the French king, whose mad ambition has\\nbrought about all this, should be living in luxury and quietness, far\\nfrom the very sound of war.\\n\\n   \"It may be, my daughter, that this is the last letter you will ever\\nreceive from your father. The duke has bestowed upon me the command of\\nmy old regiment; and should there be a battle, which seems imminent,\\nyou may be sure that your father will not be backward to do his part\\nand sustain the honour of our country. Should I fall, you will be left\\nin a position of great responsibility. Never forget, my child, that\\nyou are but the steward of your wealth, which you are to use not for\\nyour own selfish ease and pleasure, but for the honour of God and the\\ngood of your fellows, specially of those who as tenants and servants\\nare more immediately in your power and under your influence. Take your\\ncousin Deborah\\'s advice in all things, and be governed by her; but,\\nabove all, pray to your Father in heaven for the guidance of his Holy\\nSpirit.\\n\\n   \"These are matters which I have neglected too much in the course of\\nmy life; but during my imprisonment, and while I was deprived of all\\noutward solace, God was pleased to bring me to a better mind; and\\nI trust, if my life be spared, I shall serve him henceforth as a\\nChristian man should do.\\n\\n   \"One thing more, my dear Lucy: I parted with your aunt Bernard, as\\nyou know, in great anger,—not without just cause. But it is my duty\\nto pardon all, even as I would myself be pardoned. I would not appear\\nbefore God save in charity with all men. I therefore desire that you\\nwill convey to my sister Bernard the assurance of my full and free\\nforgiveness, in such way as Cousin Deborah may think best; and I also\\ndesire that you, Lucy, will forgive her for the wrongs she has done\\nyou. Cease not to pray for your father, my child; and may the God of\\nthe fatherless be your support if I am taken from you!\"\\n\\nLucy listened to this letter with quiet tears rolling down her face and\\ndropping in Cousin Deborah\\'s apron.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" she thought, \"if I only dared tell her all about the thimble! If\\nonly it were not for those dreadful things the woman spoke of!\"\\n\\n\"Now, Lucy, how shall we manage to convey your father\\'s message to Aunt\\nBernard?\" asked Cousin Deborah. \"Will you go and carry it to her?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Cousin Deborah, I dare not!\" said Lucy, turning pale. \"I dare not\\nspeak to Aunt Bernard. You don\\'t know how afraid I am of her.\"\\n\\nCousin Deborah put her arm round Lucy, and felt that she was trembling\\nat the very idea of facing her aunt. A feeling of indignation crossed\\nher mind as she thought what the tyranny must have been, which so\\naffected the child that the mere notion of speaking to Mrs. Bernard was\\ndreadful to her. She forbore to urge Lucy any further.\\n\\n\"Suppose, then, Lucy, you copy this message of your father\\'s in your\\nown handwriting, and add some words of your own. I think that will be\\nthe best course. And, my dear, I am sure you will not forget, in your\\nown secret prayers, to beseech God\\'s protection for your dear father in\\nthe perils to which he is exposed.\"\\n\\n\"Do you suppose there has been a battle, Cousin Deborah?\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n\"Of course I cannot tell, my love. You see, your father himself did\\nnot know. Great generals are not accustomed to tell their plans until\\nthey are ready to act; and I have heard that the Duke of Marlborough is\\nremarkable for keeping his own counsel. But, even if there has been no\\nbattle, your father may be in danger. Many soldiers are slain who are\\nnot killed in battle.\"\\n\\n\"Then perhaps my papa may be dead already,\" said Lucy. \"Oh, Cousin\\nDeborah, suppose I should be an orphan even now!\" And Lucy burst into\\ntears, and wept bitterly.\\n\\n\"My dearest child,\" said Cousin Deborah, taking Lucy upon her lap, and\\nwiping away the tears which fell from her own eyes, \"we cannot tell\\nwhat may have happened; but, Lucy, you must try to remember that God is\\nin Bavaria as well as here, and to trust in him to take care of your\\ndear father. \\'God is love,\\' you know St. John says in the verses we\\nread this morning.\"\\n\\n\"But God will not love me, because I am a naughty girl,\" sobbed Lucy.\\n\"Aunt Bernard said God hated me and would send his judgments to destroy\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"My dear child, never, never believe that God hates you,—no, not even\\nif you feel that you have been ever so naughty,\" said Cousin Deborah.\\n\"He sent his dear Son to die for us because we were sinners, and for no\\nother reason. It was therefore we stood in need of his death, because\\nwe were sinners. Sinner though you may be, God still loves you, and\\ndesires that you may repent and return to him; and the moment you do\\nso, he is ready to receive and forgive you and treat you as his dear\\nchild once more. Sometimes our heavenly Father sees fit to punish his\\nchildren, and so he sends some trouble upon them, even upon those who\\nare trying to follow him the most faithfully; but that is no sign he\\ndoes not love them, any more than it would be a sign I did not love you\\nbecause I saw reason to reprove you for some fault. Will you remember\\nthis, my child?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Cousin Debby,\" whispered Lucy, hiding her face on her cousin\\'s\\nbreast.\\n\\n\"Now, I want to talk to you about something else, Lucy,\" said Cousin\\nDeborah, after a little silence. \"I have received a letter from my\\ncousin Paulina, who, you know, lives in Exeter and keeps a girls\\'\\nschool. She wishes me to come and see her, that she may advise with me\\nabout some matters of importance connected with her present enterprise.\\nThere are some reasons why I do not wish to take you at present; though\\nI mean you shall go with me some day. And, if I leave you at home, will\\nyou be very steady, and do all your tasks, and be obedient to Anne?\"\\n\\n\"I will try, Cousin Debby.\"\\n\\n\"I shall be gone a day or two,—not longer, I think,\" continued Cousin\\nDeborah. \"And if I hear a good account of you on my return, and\\nsee that you have tried to give me pleasure by being faithful and\\nindustrious, I shall be very much gratified; because it will show that\\nyou are a trustworthy little girl.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Cousin Debby,\" murmured Lucy, again.\\n\\n\"Very well, my love. Then I shall venture to take this little journey,\\nhaving confidence that you will not fall into any mischief because I am\\nnot here to watch you. I trust you, Lucy.\"\\n\\n\"When shall you go, Cousin Deborah?\" asked Lucy, feeling—oh, so small\\nand mean in her own estimation, as the thought crossed her mind that\\nCousin Deborah\\'s going away would remove all hindrances to her meeting\\nthe gipsy-woman.\\n\\n\"I cannot tell until I see Mattison and find out what horse there is\\nfor me to ride. It is something of a journey,—twenty good miles; and I\\nam not so good a horsewoman as I was thirty years ago, when I rode from\\nExeter to London on the mare that all the men were afraid of.\"\\n\\nMattison was an old, broken-down trooper, who was head-groom and\\ngeneral master of the horse at Stanton Court. Consultation with him\\nrevealed the fact that there was a steady old gray horse, just the\\nthing for a lady like Mrs. Corbet, and a broken-down charger left\\nbehind by my lord, which would answer very well for Mattison, who was\\nto accompany her. So it was settled that they should take an early\\nbreakfast and set out from Stanton Court in the cool of the morning,\\nresting, during the hottest part of the day, at the house of an old\\nlady, a friend of Cousin Deborah\\'s.\\n\\nAnne was a little surprised, the next morning, to see Lady Lucy, after\\nshe had watched her cousin down the avenue, turn into the terrace\\nparlour, as it was called, and seat herself at her lute, with the\\nhour-glass by which she was used to time her tasks, on the table by\\nthe side of her lesson-book. She had expected to see Lucy take the\\nopportunity to play.\\n\\n\"You are very industrious, my lady,\" said she. \"That is not the way you\\nused to do when Mrs. Bernard went away.\"\\n\\n\"Aunt Bernard was one person, and Cousin Deborah is another,\" said\\nLucy. \"Cousin Deborah said she trusted me to be a good girl; and I am\\ngoing to try and please her. Aunt Bernard never trusted me; and you\\nknow yourself, Anne, I never could please her, do what I would. It\\nnever made one bit of difference whether I did my tasks or let them\\nalone; and so I used to feel as though I might as well do one thing as\\nan other. But Cousin Deborah always praises me if I do well and if I do\\nill, she does not seem vexed—only sorry; that makes me feel as though I\\nwanted to do every thing right.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll not say but you are in the right,\" replied Anne, seriously.\\n\"Mrs. Corbet is one of the best ladies I ever knew, I will say for her;\\nand it was a blessed day for you which put you into her hands. By the\\nway, has she ever said any thing about the thimble?\"\\n\\n\"Not a word,\" replied Lucy. \"It seems as though she must have missed\\nit; but she has never spoken about it.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand it,\" returned Anne. \"She may be waiting to see if\\nyou will find it and put it back of your own accord.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think the gipsy-woman will be able to tell where it is, Anne?\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t justly say. They do know wonderful things, to be sure. And\\nit is not safe to offend them, either; for there is no knowing what\\nrevenge they may take. There was a woman my grandmother knew, who lived\\non the edge of Exmoor,—\" And forthwith Anne plunged into a foolish\\ntale, effectually diverting Lucy\\'s mind from her practising, and making\\nher feel more than ever afraid of not keeping her appointment with the\\ngipsy.\\n\\n\"If I could only feel right about Cousin Deborah,\" said she; \"but I am\\nalmost sure she will not like it.\"\\n\\n\"She will not know it,\" argued Anne; \"and what folks don\\'t know don\\'t\\nhurt them, folks say.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know I think it does, sometimes,\" said Lucy. \"But, anyhow, I\\ncannot help feeling mean and wicked when Cousin Deborah talks about\\ntrusting me and I know that I am telling her lies and deceiving her all\\nthe time. I wish I had told her all about the thimble the first minute\\nI lost it. If I had gone out and picked it up, and told her how it came\\nout there, she might have been angry; but she would have forgiven me, I\\nknow, and it would have been all right now.\"\\n\\n\"Then why did you not tell her before she went away?\" asked Anne.\\n\\n\"That was different,\" replied Lucy. \"I had told her more than one lie\\nalready; and you know how she hates lies. And there is the gipsy-woman,\\ntoo! But please, Anne, don\\'t talk to me any more now. I want to\\npractise my music and learn my tables, as I promised Cousin Deborah.\"\\n\\nDinner-time came, and near the hour at which they had promised to\\nmeet the gipsy, Lucy and Anne were at the spring. The woman was there\\nbefore them, seated on a stone, with her red cloak drawn about her,\\nand her elbow resting on her knee. She was stirring the water of the\\nlittle spring with a peeled rod she held in her hand, and seemed to be\\nmuttering something to herself.\\n\\n\"So you are come at last,\" said the hag, sternly, addressing herself\\nto Lucy. \"Well for you that you were no later. Have you brought what I\\ntold you?\"\\n\\nLucy trembled as she drew from her pocket a small, gold-handled\\nfruit-knife and put it into the hand of the woman, whose experienced\\neyes at once told her that the metal was pure.\\n\\n\"It is small; but it may do,\" said she. She turned her back upon the\\ntwo spectators, and proceeded to rub the knife, to breathe upon it, and\\ngo through various mystical ceremonies, while Lucy and Anne looked on\\nin silent awe.\\n\\n\"You must leave this with me to-night,\" she said; \"and to-morrow at\\nthis hour you must bring me something more.\"\\n\\n\"I must not,—I dare not,\" exclaimed Lucy, in great distress.\\n\\n\"But you shall,\" said the witch, with a fearful frown, \"or great\\ntrouble will visit you. Take your choice; but remember.\" And, without\\nanother word, she turned her back upon Lucy and Anne, and stalked off\\ndown the valley by the side of the brook, till a turn in the path hid\\nher from their eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\"WELL, my lady,\" said Anne, when the old woman had disappeared, \"what\\nshall we do now?\"\\n\\nLucy stood looking at the spring, watching the tiny stream as it\\ntrickled down the rock and fell, with a soft, silver tinkle, into the\\nlittle stone basin. She stood a while in silence, and her face began to\\nassume a new expression,—a look of gentle determination, such as Anne\\nhad never seen upon it before.\\n\\n\"What shall we do, my lady?\" repeated Anne.\\n\\nAnd at the same moment, Jack, the donkey, who had stood patiently\\ndozing during the whole interview, pushed his head over Lucy\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"We will go home,\" said Lucy, lifting her eyes from the spring at last;\\n\"and we will never come here again,—never!\" she repeated, firmly.\\n\\n\"Hush, for mercy\\'s sake, my dear child!\" whispered Anne. \"You don\\'t\\nknow who may be listening to you. There! Did you hear that?\" she added,\\nstarting, as a strange sound, something like a laugh, was heard over\\ntheir heads.\\n\\nLucy looked up. \"It is the carrion crow. Don\\'t you see him up on the\\ndead tree yonder?\"\\n\\n\"The corby! Oh, my lady, what will become of us? They say he is always\\na messenger of ill.\"\\n\\n\"Ill or well, I will not come here again nor will I give that woman any\\nmore of my dear mother\\'s things. Come, Anne; put me on the donkey, and\\nlet us go home.\"\\n\\nAnne obeyed, wondering what had come over her young lady. She would\\nhave gone on talking about the corby; but Lucy stopped her.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t,—please, Anne. I want to think about something.\"\\n\\nPresently they met Dr. Burgess, striding along the path, with a stick\\nin his hand, and humming a psalm-tune.\\n\\n\"Heyday, whom have we here? My little Lady Lucy, as I am alive! And\\nwhat are you doing in this lonely place, my love?\"\\n\\n\"My lady came out for a ride, and wished to see the spring,\" Anne\\nreplied, readily enough.\\n\\n\"Ay, \\'tis a curious solitary place: is it not, my dear? There are many\\nsuch in these Devonshire coombs; and some day, if Mrs. Corbet will\\nkindly give us permission, I will take you and my own girls to see a\\nvery beautiful spring in Ferncoomb, where there are the remains of an\\nancient chapel and hermitage. \\'Tis a treat I have long promised to\\nPolly and Dulcie. Meantime, Lady Lucy, I would advise you to take your\\nrides and walks in more frequented places. These gipsies are a lawless\\ngang, and I would not have you encounter them. They are making mischief\\nin the parish, stealing fowls and fruit, and turning the girls\\' heads\\nwith their fortune-telling nonsense. I hear they have fooled Dame\\nShearer out of a good round sum, pretending to tell her where the money\\nis her husband lost coming from the fair.\"\\n\\n\"Do you not think, then, that they can tell where it is?\" Lucy gathered\\ncourage to ask.\\n\\n\"I think it not unlikely they may know where it is, but I doubt very\\nmuch whether they will ever tell her,\" answered Dr. Burgess, drily.\\n\\nHe was silent for a few moments, and then asked Lucy if she had heard\\nfrom her father since his departure.\\n\\nLucy told him she had just received a letter, and repeated what her\\nfather had said, in respect to the probability of a great battle.\\n\\n\"You will doubtless feel very anxious till you can hear again,\" said\\nthe doctor, kindly: \"but, my dear child, strive to put your trust in\\nGod and rely upon his mercy and goodness. Doubtless you pray for your\\nfather every day, and we at the parsonage will add our petitions to\\nyours.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Burgess,\" said Lucy, presently, in a low voice, and raising her\\neyes timidly to the face of the good clergyman.\\n\\n\"Well, my daughter.\"\\n\\n\"Will you please to explain something to me?\"\\n\\n\"Surely, surely, my daughter. I shall be glad to do so.\"\\n\\n\"My father says,\" continued Lucy, \"that I must ask God for the guidance\\nof his Holy Spirit. What does that mean?\"\\n\\nIn plain and well-chosen words, Dr. Burgess explained to Lucy the\\nmeaning of the phrase. \"It is your privilege and your duty to ask\\nconstantly for this guidance, my dear, young lady,\" he added. \"But\\nthen, when you have received it, you must follow it.\"\\n\\n\"How can I tell when I have received it?\" asked Lucy.\\n\\n\"Your conscience, and the word of God, must be your guide,\" replied Dr.\\nBurgess. \"When your conscience tells you that what you are about to do\\nis wrong, you must obey its voice and refrain; and when it bids you do\\nthus, and so you must obey also, no matter what it costs. Now, do you\\nunderstand?\"\\n\\n\"I think I do,\" replied Lucy. \"Thank you, sir!\"\\n\\n\"Is there any thing else I can do for you?\" asked Dr. Burgess, kindly,\\nas they came near the lodge. \"Do not fear to ask me. There is nothing\\nwhich pleases me more than to have the young people of my charge come\\nto me for advice or assistance.\"\\n\\n\"I am sure, you are very good to me; every one is very good to me, I\\nthink,\" said Lucy. \"I did not think there were such good people in the\\nworld.\"\\n\\n\"There are both good and bad in the world, as you will soon find,—as\\nindeed I think you have found already,\" replied the good clergyman,\\nsmiling. \"May God bless you, my child, and give you his grace in every\\ntime of need.\"\\n\\nLucy took in her own little fingers the broad hand the doctor laid upon\\nher head and kissed it.\\n\\n\"I love you dearly,\" she whispered. \"You will pray for my dear father,\\nand for me, too?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I will,\" said the doctor; \"and so will we all. Farewell, and\\nbe a good girl, and do not stir far from home while your good cousin is\\naway. Home is the safest place for little maids, gentle or simple.\"\\n\\n\"I am going up to my room, Anne,\" said Lucy, as she entered the door.\\n\"Please to call me when my supper is ready.\"\\n\\n\"What has got into that child?\" said Anne to herself, gazing after Lucy\\nas she ascended the broad staircase. \"She looks the very moral of my\\nlord, her father. I never thought of it before.\"\\n\\nAnd Anne, who, like others of her class, delighted in prophecies of\\nevil, pursed up her mouth, and talked so mysteriously and dolefully in\\nthe kitchen, that the little scullion maid was not a little perplexed.\\n\\n\\nWhen Anne went up to call Lady Lucy to supper, she found her reading\\nher Bible—her own mother\\'s velvet-bound and golden-clasped Bible—which\\nher father had given her before she went away.\\n\\n\"This Bible,\" he said, \"cost your dear mother her home and friends, and\\nmany a tear besides; and yet it was the greatest treasure of her heart.\\nBe sure you prize it as she did, and make it the rule of your life.\"\\n\\nAfterwards Cousin Deborah told Lucy the outline of her mother\\'s story.\\nShe had belonged to a Protestant family in the south of France, on\\nthe border of Italy; but her own father and mother dying when she was\\neight or nine years old, she had been adopted by an aunt. This aunt had\\nabandoned the Protestant principles, for which so many of her ancestors\\nhad perished upon the wheel and at the stake, and had become a Roman\\nCatholic of the strictest school. She had done her best to bring up\\nthe little Lucille in the same way. But Lucille always remembered, and\\nsecretly clung to, the faith she had learned at her dead mother\\'s knee.\\nPerhaps, too, the strictness and gloom of her aunt did not tend to make\\nthe young girl in love with her religion.\\n\\nAt any rate, when she was eighteen, she fell in with one of the\\nProtestant preachers, who had been a friend of her parents; was\\ninstructed by him more fully in their faith, and more than once\\nattended their secret meetings. And being finally threatened with\\nlifelong imprisonment in a convent, she had joined herself to one\\nof the families of the Huguenot refugees, who were leaving France\\nby hundreds at that time. And, after many perils, arrived safely in\\nLondon, where Lord Stanton, then a young soldier, met, fell in love\\nwith, and married her. This English Bible had been his first gift to\\nhis bride, and dearly did Lucy love it for her mother\\'s sake. For her\\nsake, too, she had read it every day since her father put it into her\\nhands; but now she was studying it for her own.\\n\\n\\nLucy looked up from her book as Anne entered the room. She had been\\nweeping, and the tears still hung on her long, curved eyelashes but her\\nface wore a new expression of peace and happiness.\\n\\nShe was very silent for the rest of the evening, and did not seem\\ndisposed to listen to Anne\\'s gossip as usual, but sat knitting on the\\nstocking which she had begun the day before, now and then glancing at\\nthe Bible which lay open before her at the ninety-first Psalm.\\n\\nAnne thought she was getting it by heart.\\n\\n\"How loud the sea roars!\" said Lucy. \"I haven\\'t heard it so loud since\\nwe came here.\"\\n\\n\"There is going to be a storm,\" replied Anne. \"See there is a flash\\nalready! Mercy on me, Lady Lucy! What shall we do if there is a\\nthunder-storm?\"\\n\\n\"Wait till it is over, I suppose,\" said Lucy, \"and pray that we may be\\ntaken care of.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I know one thing,\" said Anne. \"I wish that you had not angered\\nthat woman. I cannot get her face out of my mind.\"\\n\\n\"Dr. Burgess is not afraid of her, you see,\" said Lucy. \"He called her\\nan impostor, and said he meant to drive her out of the parish. I will\\nhave nothing more to do with her; of that I am resolved, come what\\nwill.\"\\n\\n\"Then you will lose the knife as well as the thimble,\" said Anne: \"and\\nwhat will your cousin say to that?\"\\n\\n\"I fear she will be very angry, but I cannot help that,\" replied Lucy.\\n\"I am not going to do any more wrong things if I can help it. One lie\\njust leads to another, and so on, till there is no end to them.\"\\n\\n\"I should just like to know what has set you on thinking of all these\\ngrave things so suddenly,\" said Anne. \"You never did so at Mrs.\\nBernard\\'s, and you read six chapters in the Bible, for one that you\\nread with Mrs. Corbet.\"\\n\\n\"That was very different,\" said Lucy. \"Aunt Bernard never explained any\\nthing to me. All she did was to slap my hands if I did not call the\\nwords right; and she kept me standing up to read till I was ready to\\ndrop, and so stupid that I could not understand any thing if I tried.\\nCousin Deborah only lets me read a short lesson at a time,—one psalm,\\nor a part of a chapter, in the New Testament,—and she explains every\\nverse, and tells me the meaning of all the hard words. It was one verse\\nwe talked about which made me resolve to have nothing more to do with\\nthe gipsy, and to confess the truth to Cousin Debby when she comes\\nhome.\"\\n\\n\"Tell me all about it,\" said Anne, willing to talk about any thing\\nrather than hold her tongue and listen to the approaching thunder, and\\nthe roar of the waves on the beach below. \"What was the verse?\"\\n\\n\"It was, \\'If I regard wickedness in my heart, the Lord will not hear\\nme!\\'\" repeated Lucy. \"Cousin Deborah said that meant that if we kept\\nwicked thoughts in our minds, and wicked desires in our hearts, God\\nwould not hear our prayers. She said that we need not be afraid to\\npray, even though we had been ever so wicked, if only we were truly\\nsorry for our sin; but unless we were sorry, and meant to leave off our\\nsin, there was no use in praying.\"\\n\\n\"True enough,\" said Anne, in rather a sleepy tone. \"My! What a flash.\\nThe storm is coming nearer and nearer.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" continued Lucy, \"then came the letter from my dear father, in\\nwhich he said they were going to have a dreadful battle, and asked me\\nto pray to God for him. I do want to pray for him,\" said Lucy, with a\\ntrembling voice. \"It seems to be all the comfort there is, when I think\\nof him in the midst of the swords and cannon balls, or perhaps lying on\\nthe ground wounded under the horses\\' feet, like that poor soldier in\\nthe great picture down-stairs: but what is the use of my praying, if I\\nam inclining to wickedness with my heart all the time?\"\\n\\n\"These are grave thoughts for a little lady like you,\" said Anne, not\\naltogether at ease in her own mind. \"I am sure the parson could not\\nsay all that any better. I don\\'t like filling a young head with such\\nthings, for my part. Time enough when you grow an old lady, like Mrs.\\nCorbet.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I shall never live to be an old lady like Mrs. Corbet,\" said\\nLucy: \"and the French soldiers will not wait for me to grow up, to\\nshoot at my dear papa.\"\\n\\n\"And that is true, too,\" said Anne. \"Well, my dear, I am sure I am glad\\nyou find comfort in the Bible, and I would be the last one to oppose\\nyou. I remember when my poor sister was in the waste of which she died;\\nafter her sweetheart was drowned in the fishing-boat, the Bible was her\\nonly comfort. I have been sorry ever since, that I let you have any\\nthing to do with that gipsy-woman; and I shall never forgive myself if\\nharm comes of it to you.\"\\n\\n\"What harm can come besides the loss of the knife and of my silver\\nsixpence? I do not believe the Lord will hear that wicked woman,—for\\nI am sure she is wicked,—and you know, Anne, if he takes care of us,\\nnothing can harm us. I was learning a beautiful psalm this very evening\\nwhich tells about that. Shall I say it to you?\"\\n\\nAnne assented; and Lady Lucy repeated the ninety-first psalm.\\nLong before it was finished, Anne was sound asleep. And Lucy,\\nnotwithstanding the thunder, lightning, and rain, soon followed her\\nexample.\\n\\nWhen she opened her eyes, it was broad daylight. The sun was shining,\\nand a dear little robin-redbreast was singing his song right on her\\nwindow-seat. Lucy slipped out of bed and went to the window. Every\\nthing was drenched and dripping with wet. It had evidently blown hard\\nduring the night, for in more than one place, broken branches were\\nhanging on the trees or lying on the grass: but every thing glittered\\nin the sunlight, the air was fresh and sweet, and the world seemed to\\nbe rejoicing in the new light of morning.\\n\\nThankful tears rose to Lucy\\'s eyes, and she repeated the words of her\\nmorning hymn:—\\n\\n   \"Glory to Him who safe hath kept,\\n    And hath preserved me while I slept;\\n    Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake,\\n    I may of endless life partake.\"\\n\\nShe stole softly to the door and opened it a little way. There lay a\\nfriend indeed, no less than Goodman, the old bloodhound, who had been a\\npuppy when her father went away, and had known him again when he came\\nback. Old Goodman who was allowed to go about as he liked, and who had\\nmore than once hidden himself in the house and stayed all night in some\\nsnug corner. He now lay comfortably snoozing on the mat, but lifted his\\nhead and knocked his tail against the floor as Lucy opened the door.\\n\\n\"You dear, faithful, old dog,\" said Lucy, bending over him and patting\\nthe great head tenderly. \"Did you come to take care of your little\\nmistress, you dear dog? You shall have some of my breakfast and sleep\\nhere every night till Cousin Deborah comes home. And you will take care\\nof your little mistress, won\\'t you, old fellow?\"\\n\\nGoodman lazily put up his tawny muzzle and licked Lucy\\'s face, as if\\nratifying this treaty on his own part. And Lucy, feeling her heart\\nlighter than for many a day, went back to her room to dress.\\n\\n\"Dear me, Lady Lucy, are you up already?\" asked Anne, sleepily. \"I am\\nsure it is very early.\"\\n\\n\"It is six o\\'clock and a beautiful morning,\" replied Lucy, adding\\nrather mischievously: \"I should think you had slept sound enough, Anne.\\nYou never heard the storm last night. And, Anne, go down and see about\\nmy breakfast. I should like to be alone a little while.\"\\n\\nAll that day Lucy kept herself closely within the limits of the house\\nand garden, doing her task with punctilious accuracy. She even resumed\\nthe open-hem ruffling which had lain untouched in her drawer ever since\\nshe came from Aunt Bernard\\'s, intending to ask Cousin Deborah if she\\nmight make it into something for the twins at the lodge, in which she\\ntook a great interest. She would have liked to go down and see the\\ndear little babies, but she thought it likely enough that she might\\nencounter the gipsy-woman, and she wisely judged it best to keep out of\\nher way.\\n\\nThe old bloodhound, her self-elected guardian, was faithful to his\\ntrust, stalking up and down the terrace at Lucy\\'s side, sitting at her\\nelbow at meal-times, and lying at her feet while she was reading or\\nworking in the terrace parlour. There was nothing very remarkable in\\nthe dog\\'s taking a fancy to the lonely little girl, who had always a\\nkind word for him in passing and often gave him a share of the bun, or\\nthe bit of ginger-bread which Cousin Deborah allowed her. Neither was\\nit surprising, that Goodman should prefer lying on the Turkey carpet in\\nthe parlour to reposing upon the flags outside.\\n\\nNevertheless, Anne chose to see in it a new marvel, and pointed it out\\nto Jenny with many significant shrugs and winks.\\n\\nWhen Lucy went to bed, Goodman still accompanied her, and settled\\nhimself down on the mat in a composed matter-of-fact way, which moved\\nAnne to say that the dog had more sense than some Christians.\\n\\nThere was another thunder-storm in the night, but Lucy only roused\\nherself to wonder whether there were any fishermen out in their boats\\nfrom the cove below; to murmur a prayer for them, and for her father\\nand cousin and then sank to sleep again.\\n\\n\\n\"Will Mattison has come home,\" was the news which met Lucy, as she came\\ndown-stairs the next morning. \"He is waiting to speak to you.\"\\n\\n\"Has not my cousin come, then?\" asked Lucy, her heart beating fast.\\n\"Oh, Anne, has any thing happened to Cousin Deborah?\"\\n\\n\"Now, don\\'t, my lady! I don\\'t think any harm has come to Mrs. Corbet;\\nbut Will will tell you all about it. Shall I send him in to you?\"\\n\\nIt turned out that nothing serious was the matter. Cousin Deborah had\\nmet an old friend in Exeter, who persuaded her to stay a night with her\\nupon the road. And she had sent Will Mattison home with her parcels,\\nthat he might apprise Lady Lucy of the cause of her delay.\\n\\n\"I got to the village last night just as the storm came up,\" concluded\\nWill: \"so I thought it better to put up at the ale-house, rather than\\nrun the risk of spoiling my mistress\\' bundles of mercery. And, my lady,\\nif I might presume to offer my advice, you will not stir outside the\\ngardens and park while your cousin is away. I heard a deal of talk\\nabout the gipsies, down at the village last night. They say they are a\\ndesperate gang, and the very same that was chased out of Somersetshire\\nthis spring. Not as I believe all the nonsense folks tell about the\\ngipsies either. I dare say there may be good and bad among them, but\\nthese here is a bad-looking set, surely, and it wouldn\\'t be altogether\\npleasant for a young lady to meet with them. I hope you will excuse the\\nfreedom, my lady—\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right, Will, and I thank you for your care of me. You\\nsee I have one guard already,\" added Lucy, patting the head of the old\\ndog. \"Now go and tell cook to give you a good breakfast.\"\\n\\n\"I never did see any one so changed as my young lady,\" said Will, as he\\nreturned to the kitchen. \"When she first came here, she was as scared\\nas a young fawn, and the moment any one spoke to her, her great black\\neyes were looking every way like a startled hares: but now she seems to\\nhave plucked up a spirit, and speaks so quiet and dignified like. That\\nold woman must have used the child awful to have cowed and broken her\\nspirit so. It makes my old blood boil to think of it.\"\\n\\n\\nLucy ate her breakfast with old Goodman sitting at her elbow\\ncontentedly munching the crusts she gave him. Then she walked a while\\nupon the terrace; visited and inspected a litter of kittens which Will\\nhad found in the stable; and finally sat down to her lessons in the\\nbow-window, with the dog still in close attendance.\\n\\nShe had finished her practising and learned her spelling-lesson, and\\nwas sitting industriously working at the open-hem she used to dislike\\nso much, when the window was suddenly darkened by a shadow, and, at the\\nsame moment, Goodman bristled up and gave a deep growl.\\n\\nLucy looked up.\\n\\nThere before the open window stood the gipsy-woman, with her black\\nglittering eyes fixed upon Lucy\\'s face.\\n\\n\"So, my young lady, this is the way you keep your promise to the\\ngipsy-woman! You bring me to the place appointed and keep me waiting,\\nthe whole afternoon while you take your pleasure at home. But beware\\nwhat you do! I am not to be played with, as you may find to your cost\\nsome day.\"\\n\\nFor the moment, Lucy\\'s fears overmastered her new-found faith and\\ncourage. She sat pale and trembling, unable to stir or even to call for\\nhelp. The wicked woman saw her advantage.\\n\\n\"Did you hear the storm last night and the night before? Ay, but did\\nyou know what was riding upon the lightning and the wind, waiting only\\nfor my word to lay this proud roof-tree and all beneath it low in the\\ndust? You little know what my art can do yet for good or evil!\"\\n\\nShe fixed her eyes upon the work-box which stood open on the table, and\\ncontinued, in a still fiercer tone, \"Give me something from that box as\\nI bade you; give me my choice from it, and you shall find all you have\\nlost, and be lucky and prosperous henceforth. Refuse or betray me, and\\nyou shall never know one peaceful night more, but shall pine and pine,\\ntill you shall wish in vain for death to release you. Give it me, I\\nsay, or I will take it.\"\\n\\n\"I will not!\" returned Lucy, finding her voice and her courage all at\\nonce. \"You are a wicked woman; and I will not give you any more of my\\ndear mother\\'s things. Goodman, watch good dog!\"\\n\\nThe woman made a stride forward, and stretched out her hand towards the\\nbox.\\n\\nGoodman seemed to think the time had come for action. With a fearful\\ngrowl, he sprang forward in his turn, and would have caught her by the\\nthroat.\\n\\nBut, luckily for her, a rough hand was laid upon her shoulder pulling\\nher back, and a rough voice said,—\\n\\n\"Halloo, mistress! What are you about here, frightening my young lady?\\nDown, Goodman, but watch. Be quiet, woman! The dog would as soon pull\\nyou down as a deer, if I gave him the word. What are you about, my\\nlady, talking with such riff-raff?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Will Mattison, I am so glad you are come!\" exclaimed Lucy,\\nbursting into tears. \"Oh, take her away!\"\\n\\nThe woman smoothed her frowning brow and softened her tones\\nwonderfully. \"Nay, master, no need to be so rough. There is no harm\\ndone nor meant, only my little honey-sweet lady is so easily scared. If\\nshe would but listen a moment, she would hear the fine fortune I have\\nto tell her.\"\\n\\n\"Coarse or fine, we want none of your fortunes: so you may just troop\\noff,\" said Will, stoutly. \"My lady, have you any thing to say to this\\nwoman?\"\\n\\n\"No, oh, no! Take her away, but do not hurt her.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I will go fast enough, never fear. No need to bid your man drive\\nme away. I will go fast enough, never to return; and no more shall some\\none else, neither shall that which is lost ever be found again: mind\\nthat, my fair lady. Never again shall you find what you have lost or\\nsee your father\\'s face. Yes, I will go; but, mayhap, I will send them\\nin my place that shall make my scornful lady wish the old gipsy back\\nagain, but I shall be far away. Oh, yes, I will go.\"\\n\\n\"Go, then, and make us quit of you,\" said the sturdy old trooper, not\\nat all alarmed at this mysterious threat. \"I am too old a soldier to\\nbe scared at a woman\\'s tongue, be she young or old. I\\'ve seen plenty\\nof your sort in Germany and the low countries, where they use less\\nceremony with vagrants than here. Come, troop!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Will, don\\'t anger her!\" said Anne, who had come in and stood\\ntrembling at the scene. \"Don\\'t anger her. There\\'s no knowing what she\\nmay do. What if she should curse you?\"\\n\\n\"Let her,\" returned Will. \"I will tell you, girl, a good saying I\\nlearned long ago from the Moors at Tangier; \\'Curses are like young\\nchickens, they always come home to roost.\\' I am a Christian man I trow,\\nand shall I have less courage than a heathen Moor? Come, mistress;\\ntroop, I say!\"\\n\\n\"Well, I do say it is a fine thing to travel abroad,\" said Anne,\\nlooking at Will as he followed the woman along the terrace. \"Just hear\\nhow she is cursing him! I wouldn\\'t be in his place for something.\"\\n\\n\"She is gone, my lady,\" said Will, presently reappearing at the\\nbow-window. \"I promise you she gave it to me finely. Such a foul mouth\\nI never heard, even among the gipsies. But don\\'t you fear her. I don\\'t\\nbelieve the good Lord is going to bring evil on this honourable house\\nfor any curses of hers. So don\\'tee cry any more, my dear young lady,\\ndon\\'tee now,\" continued the good old man, as Lucy\\'s tears still fell\\nfast upon the head of old Goodman, which he had laid on her knee; \"but\\nbe a brave maid and all will be well. Goodman and old Will Mattison\\nwill take good care of you till Mrs. Corbet returns. And in good time\\nhere she comes,\" he added, looking towards the avenue. \"I wonder what\\nhas brought her home so early in the day? Anyhow, I am glad to see her,\\nand I must go and hold her horse. So wipe up your tears, there\\'s a\\nbrave maid, and go to meet your cousin.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\"WHAT! Tears upon your cheeks, my Lucy,\" said Mrs. Corbet, as she\\ndismounted from her horse and bent to kiss Lucy. \"Nay, my child, that\\nis but a sorry welcome.\"\\n\\n\"My lady has just been frightened by a gipsy-woman, and no shame to\\nher,\" said Will Mattison. \"She came to the window as bold as brass,\\nwhen my lady was alone all but old Goodman, and a fearsome bold hag she\\nwas; but I sent her to the right about, I promise you. You have come\\nearlier than I expected, madam.\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I had the offer of good company in the Vicar of Clevelay, who\\nwas riding this way, and I thought best to accept it. And so you had a\\nfright, my love? I am sorry for that; but put it out of your mind now.\\nNo harm shall happen to you. Good old dog,—brave Goodman! Have you been\\ntaking care of Lucy?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed he has, cousin! He has slept at my door every night since you\\nwent away, and he will not leave me a moment.\"\\n\\n\"Were you frightened at the thunder, Lucy?\"\\n\\n\"I was the first night, but not the second,\" said Lucy. \"I went to\\nsleep in the midst of it.\"\\n\\n\"That was well. Now, come up with me in my room, while I take off my\\nhat and habit.\"\\n\\nThere was a shade of anxiety and care under all Cousin Debby\\'s cheery\\nmanner. The truth was, she had heard the report that there had been a\\ngreat battle fought between the Duke of Marlborough\\'s forces and those\\nof the French king. It was no more than a rumour; but Cousin Debby well\\nknew how apt such rumours are to prove true, and she wished to be at\\nhome with Lucy when any authentic news should arrive.\\n\\nIt was with a fluttering and sinking heart that Lucy followed her\\ncousin along the gallery to her own room. She had fully determined\\nto confess all her fault to Cousin Debby, whatever might be the\\nconsequence; nor did she swerve from her resolution as the time drew\\nnear for putting it into practice. Nevertheless, she trembled so\\nviolently that her limbs almost failed to support her, when she found\\nherself alone with Mrs. Corbet in her own room.\\n\\nIf Cousin Deborah noticed her agitation, she probably imputed it to\\nLucy\\'s late fright; for she made no remark upon it, but talked to Lucy\\nof her journey, as she took off her riding-hat and bathed her face and\\nhands. Then, sitting down in her chair, she called the little girl to\\nher side, and put into her hands a small case, which she took from her\\npocket.\\n\\n\"Open it, my dear! See, this is the way.\"\\n\\nLucy opened it, and started with surprise. There lay the missing\\nthimble, in all its old beauty of blue and white enamel, the gold as\\nbright and pure as ever, with her mother\\'s name upon the side.\\n\\n\"Had you missed it?\" asked Cousin Deborah. \"I had an opportunity of\\nsending to Exeter: so I despatched it to the goldsmith there to be\\nmended and made a little smaller, that you might sometimes have the\\npleasure of using your mother\\'s thimble. Why, Lucy, my dear child, what\\nis the matter?\"\\n\\nFor Lucy had dropped upon her knees by her cousin\\'s side, and, hiding\\nher face in her lap, was crying so bitterly, that her whole frame was\\nconvulsed by her sobs.\\n\\n\"Hush! Hush! My child. You will make yourself ill,\" said Cousin\\nDeborah, soothing her. \"What is it makes you cry? Did you think the\\nthimble was lost?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Cousin Debby, I have been so wicked,\" sobbed Lucy. \"You will never\\nlove me again, when I tell you what I have done.\"\\n\\n\"I shall not cease to love you, though you have been ever so naughty,\\nif I see you are sorry for what you have done,\" said Cousin Deborah,\\ngravely but kindly. \"Compose yourself, my child, and tell me all about\\nthe matter.\"\\n\\nIn low tones, and often interrupted with sobs, Lucy confessed the\\nwhole, hiding nothing, and making no attempt to excuse herself.\\n\\nCousin Deborah listened in silence.\\n\\nAs Lucy finished her tale, she laid her head again upon her cousin\\'s\\nknee. She expected to feel herself lifted roughly to her feet, and\\nshaken out of breath; but she seemed determined to keep hold of her\\nrefuge as long as possible.\\n\\nBut in a minute, a gentle hand stroked down her hair, and a gentle\\nvoice said,—\\n\\n\"My poor, little, weak-spirited girl! Could you not trust Cousin\\nDeborah?\"\\n\\nLucy\\'s tears flowed fast once more, but they were very different tears.\\n\\n\"See how much harm has come from your cowardice,\" continued Cousin\\nDeborah. \"If you had told me directly you lost the thimble, I should\\nhave been displeased, indeed, at your disobedience, but there would\\nhave been the end. You would have been spared all this grief, and\\nanxiety, and all the terrors you suffered from the gipsy-woman. You\\nwould not have lost your dear mother\\'s knife, and, above all, Lucy, you\\nwould not have been tempted to tell so many lies.\"\\n\\n\"I kept thinking all the time that I would not tell any more,\" said\\nLucy; \"but, somehow, they kept coming all the more.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that is always the way. One lie leads to another, till we become\\ninvolved in a web of deceit, and feel as if we knew not how to stir\\nhand or foot. I am thankful you had the courage to break away at last.\"\\n\\n\"It was that verse about inclining unto wickedness that helped me\\nmore than any thing,\" said Lucy, gathering courage from her cousin\\'s\\nkindness. \"I kept thinking how I could pray for papa, while I was being\\nso naughty.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Cousin Deborah, encouragingly, as Lucy paused, \"what then?\"\\n\\n\"I thought of it there at the spring, when the witch threatened that\\nI should never see papa again unless I brought her something more,\"\\ncontinued Lucy, \"and that made me resolve I would never go again,\\nwhatever happened to me, and that I would tell you all about it.\"\\n\\nLucy went on to tell her cousin about her meeting and conversation\\nwith Dr. Burgess, and added, \"I am not quite sure I did right, cousin,\\nbut when I came home, I shut myself up in my own room and prayed to\\nGod to forgive me, and give me his Holy Spirit, as the doctor said;\\nand, Cousin Debby, was it wicked? It did really seem as if he heard me\\nand gave me new strength and courage; and then I resolved again that\\nI would tell all about it as soon as you came home. Was it really his\\nguiding me by his Spirit, Cousin Deborah?\" asked Lucy, in a tone of\\ndeep awe.\\n\\n\"I have not a doubt of it, my child.\"\\n\\n\"And you will forgive me, won\\'t you, cousin?\" pleaded Lucy. \"Indeed,\\nindeed, I am so very sorry!\"\\n\\n\"I forgive you with all my heart, my dear,\" said Cousin Deborah,\\nkissing her; \"and I trust you will never be so foolish again as to\\nbe afraid of me. Now, I must send Will Mattison with a note to Dr.\\nBurgess, if perhaps he may be able to do something towards recovering\\nthe knife. Stay you here, meanwhile, and we will talk of the matter\\nagain.\"\\n\\nWhen Cousin Deborah returned, she took Lucy on her lap, and talked\\nwith her very seriously about the sin she had committed. Lucy was very\\npenitent and very much ashamed; nevertheless, she felt happier than she\\nhad done in a long time. Cousin Deborah explained to her also the folly\\nof supposing that God would reveal to an ignorant, wicked woman the\\nthings which were about to happen, or which had happened at a distance,\\nand of thinking that he would allow such a person to harm his own\\nchildren by enchantments or spells.\\n\\n\"But they do know things somehow,\" Lucy ventured to say, \"or how could\\nthat woman have guessed it was a thimble I had lost?\"\\n\\n\"Did not you and Anne say something about it?\"\\n\\n\"I remember now I did tell Anne to ask her about the thimble,\" said\\nLucy, \"and perhaps she overheard me. I remember, too, she did not know\\nwhether it was a silver or a gold thimble. Yet, if she had known where\\nit was, she might have told what it was made of, one would think. But,\\nCousin Debby, she knew that my father was at the war, and that Jack\\nMartin went with him.\"\\n\\n\"I dare say and so does every one in the village know it, and that\\nAnne and Jack Martin were engaged to be married: so you see there is\\nnothing wonderful in that. No doubt they pick up a great deal of such\\ninformation which they use as occasion serves. Then, too, their tribes\\nare scattered all over the world, and are said to keep up constant\\nintercourse with one another: so they may often obtain news of what is\\npassing abroad in a way which seems very wonderful to those not in the\\nsecret.\"\\n\\n\"Who are the gipsies, Cousin Deborah? They do not look like English\\npeople.\"\\n\\n\"It is not known from whence they came in the first place. They\\nseem to have made their first appearance in Europe in the fifteenth\\ncentury, (there were more than one hundred in Paris in 1427), and were\\nthen believed to have come from Egypt. Gipsy is from the French word\\nEgyptien. There have been a great many speculations concerning them. *\\nThey evidently have a language and customs of their own. They are a\\ngreat pest wherever they go, from their thieving, begging habits, and\\nit may be doubted whether they are not often concerned in worse crimes.\"\\n\\n   * Mr. Grellmann supposes that they are of the lowest class of East\\nIndians, viz., Pariahs, or Soodras, and that they were driven from\\nHindoostan to Europe, by Timur Beg, in 1408 or 1409.\\n\\n\"Why do not people try to teach them better, Cousin Deborah?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, that is a question I have often asked myself. It does not\\nseem to me that Christian people have awaked to their duty in that\\nrespect, and that something might be done for these wretched outcasts.\\nTheir unsettled mode of life, however, is much in the way of gaining\\nany influence over them. And so long as they can make a subsistence by\\ntheir pretended acts of fortune-telling and treasure-finding, they are\\nnot likely to settle to any honest employment.\\n\\n\"I hope, my dear Lucy, you will never be so foolish again as to go to\\nthese wretched people for any such purpose. And, now, tell me another\\nthing, Lucy. Do you think it is a very pleasant thing for a little girl\\nto have secrets which she is afraid will be found out by those who have\\nthe care of her?\"\\n\\n\"No, indeed, Cousin Deborah! I hope I shall never have another secret\\nas long as I live.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" continued Cousin Deborah, \"that the way in which you have\\nhitherto been brought up has made you timid and reserved. You have\\nalways been so severely treated for every little fault and mishap, that\\nyou have fallen into the habit of concealing your faults, and even of\\nlying to hide them. Now this is a very sad habit, and one of which you\\nmust take great pains to break yourself. It is cowardice, and leads to\\na great deal of meanness and wickedness.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Lucy. \"It made me tell lies about the thimble; and\\nI did use to tell a great many to Aunt Bernard, I know; but, oh, Cousin\\nDebby, if you knew how she used to punish me for the least little\\nthing! She would not let me have one bit of drink with my meals for a\\nwhole week once, because I spilled some milk on my slip; and it was her\\nspeaking sharply to me that made me spill it, too. Oh, it did seem as\\nif I should choke just eating dry crust for my breakfast and supper!\" *\\n\\n* A fact.\\n\\n\"I know all that, Lucy, and that has been an excuse for you heretofore;\\nbut it will be so no longer. I want you to feel, my child, how mean and\\nwicked it is to tell a lie, whether it is to hide a fault or to escape\\npunishment; and I wish you to have enough confidence in me to come to\\nme in all your troubles great and small. Will you not try to do this?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Cousin Debby.\" Lucy Was silent for a few minutes, leaning on her\\ncousin\\'s breast. Then she said, softly, \"Cousin!\"\\n\\n\"Well, my love!\"\\n\\n\"I should like to write out that piece of my father\\'s letter for Aunt\\nBernard.\"\\n\\n\"You shall do so, Lucy. Do you not feel now that you can add some words\\nof your own, telling poor Aunt Bernard that you forgive her for your\\nown part?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Cousin Debby. I feel differently now. But, cousin, I don\\'t think\\nit would be true for me to say that I loved Aunt Bernard.\"\\n\\n\"You need not say so; but Lucy, can you not think of something for\\nwhich you ought to beg Aunt Bernard\\'s pardon? Did you not do some wrong\\nthings?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Cousin Debby, I know I did. What shall I write?\"\\n\\n\"I shall not tell you what to say, Lucy. You shall write just what you\\nthink and feel, and show it to me afterwards, if you please. Here is\\npaper, pens, and ink in my cabinet. You may sit down here and write,\\nwhile I put away my habit and my other things.\"\\n\\nLucy was just sitting down to write, when, glancing out of a\\nside-window, she exclaimed: \"Oh, Cousin Debby, here comes Will Mattison\\ngalloping up the avenue as hard as he can pelt, and waving his hat. And\\nall the church bells are ringing. Oh, what has happened?\"\\n\\n\"I presume there is some news come from the war,\" said Cousin Debby.\\n\"Let us go down and see. Do not tremble so, my dearest child, but look\\nup to your heavenly Father for strength.\"\\n\\n\"News! Madam and my lady! Great news from the war!\" exclaimed Will,\\nthrowing himself from his smoking horse at the hall door. \"There has\\nbeen a great victory, and lord is safe and well! Here are letters come\\nfrom him. The man who brought them rode post from London, and his horse\\nwas wearied out as well as himself.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God, my dear Lucy, your father is well!\" said Cousin Deborah,\\nglancing at the hurried note. \"Sit down and hear what he says.\"\\n\\nLucy was glad to sit down, for her limbs trembled too much to support\\nher. The letter was dated at Blenheim, the fourteenth day of August,\\n1704, and was as follows:—\\n\\n   \"MY DEAREST DAUGHTER:—Yesterday being Sunday, the thirteenth day of\\nAugust, 1704, was fought the most dreadful battle I have ever yet\\nseen, resulting in a complete victory on our part over the French and\\ntheir allies. The carnage on both sides has been dreadful, but we have\\nsuffered much less than the French. I have got off with a sabre cut on\\nmy forehead, which is no great matter, but will not improve my beauty.\\n\\n   \"Of the men who went with me from Stanton-Corbet, two or three are hurt\\nslightly, but none are killed save poor Jack Martin, who was shot down\\nclose at my elbow, while behaving with great bravery. Tell his mother\\nfrom me that her son was a good soldier and a good man, and I make no\\ndoubt is now in a better place. And do you, my love, see that both she\\nand poor Anne have proper mourning at my expense. The good widow must\\nhenceforth have her cottage rent-free and a pension.\\n\\n   \"I will write more particularly in a day or two. Such another Sunday\\nI trust never to pass. It would break your heart to see the village\\nof Blenheim, so neat and thriving a few days ago, now a smoking mass\\nof ruins, strewed with dead and disfigured corpses, and the poor\\ninhabitants scattered no one knows where, all their little property\\ndestroyed or ruined. I can write no more now, as I must sent off this\\nwithin an hour. Let the messenger have good entertainment.\"\\n\\nTears of mingled thankfulness and grief streamed down Lucy\\'s cheeks.\\n\"Oh, I am so glad dear papa is safe! But poor, poor widow Martin, and\\npoor Anne! She was so certain that Jack would come safe out of the war\\nbecause the gipsy said so.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and at the very time she was saying the words, poor Jack was\\nlying still and cold in his bloody grave,\" said Cousin Deborah. \"You\\nsee this battle happened a week ago last Sunday. And your father, whom\\nshe threatened so, is safe and well, and the thimble is found. So much\\nfor the gipsy\\'s predictions.\"\\n\\n\"But, cousin, it is very odd about the thimble!\" said Lucy, diverted\\nfrom her letter for a moment. \"Where did you find it?\"\\n\\n\"Standing on the table beside the box.\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand it,\" repeated Lucy. \"It certainly was lying there\\nunder the aloe-leaves when I went out with you that day.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps Robbins picked it up and laid it upon the table,\" said Cousin\\nDeborah. \"He might have done so, and then forgotten all about it, for\\nhe grows more and more forgetful all the time. But now, my love, go and\\nwrite the good news to Aunt Bernard, while I look after poor Anne.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Lady Lucy\\'s Secret._ \\n Great news from the wars.]\\n\\nLucy\\'s own part of the letter was as follows:—\\n\\n   \"DEAR AUNT BERNARD:—This came in a letter from my father last Tuesday,\\nand Cousin Deborah bade me write it out for you. We have got news this\\nday that there has been a great battle, and the English have beat,\\nand my papa is well, only he has got a cut on his face, but poor Jack\\nMartin, Anne\\'s bachelor, is killed. Dear Aunt Bernard, I know I was a\\nnaughty girl a great many times, and I hope you will forgive me, as I\\ndo you. I hope you will excuse blots, for I cannot help crying when I\\nthink about poor Jack Martin and his mother.\"\\n\\n\"That will do very well!\" said Cousin Deborah, when Lucy showed her the\\nletter. \"No, you need not copy it. Send it as it is.\"\\n\\nSo Lucy sent her little letter to Aunt Bernard; but I am sorry to say\\nshe never received any answer.\\n\\nWhen any one has gone on for many years like this poor, unhappy lady,\\nindulging the passions of anger, pride, and an unforgiving temper, the\\nheart sometimes becomes so hardened that it seems impossible to make\\nany impression upon it. Possibly Mrs. Bernard may have been sorry in\\nher own heart that she had been so cruel to Lucy, but she never said so.\\n\\nWhen Anne had a little recovered from her grief at the loss of her\\nsweetheart, Cousin Deborah talked with her seriously about the fault\\nshe had committed in helping Lucy to deceive, and in going with her to\\nmeet the gipsy-woman. Anne acknowledged her error and promised to do\\nbetter. And Cousin Deborah took care to avoid all risk, by keeping Lucy\\nwith herself till the child had framed the habit of being truthful and\\nopen. This was not gained in a day, for bad habits are hard to overcome.\\n\\nBut Lucy was very much in earnest, and under Cousin Deborah\\'s gentle\\nand wise government, she had few temptations to hide her faults and\\nmishaps. By degrees, she lost the frightened, crushed manner which had\\ngrown upon her under Aunt Bernard\\'s reign. She grew strong and active\\nin mind and body, and at the end of a year could work in the garden,\\nwalk, ride, and run races as well as Polly Burgess herself.\\n\\nHannah, who now and then saw her playing with the little girls at\\nthe rectory, or going about to see the poor people, reported to her\\nmistress that the child had grown a regular tomboy.\\n\\n\\nAnd when Lord Stanton came home at the end of a year, he professed\\nhimself perfectly satisfied with the manners and appearance of his\\ndaughter, and begged Cousin Deborah to take up her permanent residence\\nat the Court, and continue to superintend Lucy\\'s education. Mrs. Corbet\\nmade her arrangements accordingly, and she remained with Lady Lucy till\\nlong after she was a married lady, with little ones of her own about\\nher.\\n\\nLucy never heard any news of her knife. The gipsies decamped on the\\nvery day that the news came of the battle of Blenheim, nor did the same\\ntribe ever visit Stanton-Corbet again.\\n\\nIt turned out as Cousin Deborah had supposed, that old Robbins had\\npicked up the thimble and laid it on the table where Cousin Deborah\\nfound it, and, as usual, had forgotten all about it the next minute.\\nLucy used it every day, and never again forgot to put it in its place.\\n\\nWhen Mrs. Bernard died, some years after, Lady Lucy gave old Margery a\\npretty little cottage and garden, and to wait upon her, a little orphan\\ngirl, the child of a fisherman from the cove below. This was the first\\nrevival of the Stanton-Corbet almshouses, which had been founded by\\nanother little girl, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, and of which we\\nmay perhaps hear more some day.\\n\\nAnother cottage was inhabited by the Widow Martin, and a third by an\\nold soldier, who had accompanied Lucy\\'s father all through the war, and\\ncame home with only one leg, to die in his native village. Lucy found\\ngreat pleasure in visiting and working for these poor women, and her\\nsewing hours no longer seemed the most tiresome part of the day, when\\nshe was making an apron for one, or a Sunday cap and apron for another\\nof her old friends.\\n\\n\\n\\n                               THE END.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LADY LUCY\\'S SECRET; ***\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n'"
