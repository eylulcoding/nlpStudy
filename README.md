-In this file I made some exercises related to NLP. 

*This project focuses on the text analysis and visualization of the book "Lady Lucy's Secret" by Lucy Ellen Guernsey. The main objectives of this project are to:

Tokenize and clean the text data.
Calculate the frequency of words, excluding common stopwords.
Identify the top 30 most frequently occurring words.
Visualize the word frequencies using a bar plot and a word cloud.
Perform readability analysis on the text.


Top 30 Most Frequent Words: The most frequently occurring words are listed along with their counts.
Bar Plot: A bar plot showing the frequencies of the top 30 words.
Word Cloud: A word cloud visualization of the most frequently occurring words.
Readability Analysis: Readability statistics of the text.
